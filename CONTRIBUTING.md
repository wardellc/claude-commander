# Contributing

Maintainer and developer documentation for Claude Commander. Coding conventions,
testing rules, and architecture notes for working in the codebase live in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md); this file covers releasing, the local dev loop, and a
high-level architecture overview.

## Releasing

Releases are cut with [`cargo-release`](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release):

```bash
cargo install cargo-release            # one-time

cargo release patch                    # X.Y.Z -> X.Y.(Z+1), dry-run
cargo release minor                    # X.Y.Z -> X.(Y+1).0, dry-run
cargo release major                    # X.Y.Z -> (X+1).0.0, dry-run
cargo release 1.2.3                    # explicit version, dry-run

cargo release <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z> --execute   # actually release
```

Every invocation is a dry-run by default; add `--execute` once the printed plan looks right. The command bumps the version in `Cargo.toml`, refreshes `Cargo.lock`, creates a GPG-signed commit (`Bump version to X.Y.Z`) and a GPG-signed tag (`vX.Y.Z`), and pushes both to `origin/main`.

The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/publish-tap.yml`, which creates the GitHub release with auto-generated notes and bumps the formula in [`sizeak/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/sizeak/homebrew-tap) so `brew upgrade claude-commander` sees the new version within ~60 seconds. In parallel, `.github/workflows/publish-aur.yml` rewrites the `sha256sums` line in `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` against the new GitHub source tarball and pushes the result to the [`claude-commander`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/claude-commander) AUR package so `yay -Syu claude-commander` picks it up.

The AUR job depends on:

- A repo secret `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` containing the private half of an SSH key registered against the maintainer's [aur.archlinux.org](https://aur.archlinux.org) account.
- The package already existing on AUR — the first publish must be done by hand (`git clone ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/claude-commander.git`, copy `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`, run `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO`, commit and push). Every subsequent tag is handled by the workflow.

`cargo-release` keeps `pkgver` in `packaging/aur/PKGBUILD` in sync with `Cargo.toml` via the `pre-release-replacements` block in `release.toml`; the workflow fills in `sha256sums` at publish time.

## Development

Use `scripts/build.sh` for final verification. By default it clears the current
checkout's Rust and Flutter build directories first, retaining only that run's
artifacts. Downloads and source changes are preserved. Pass verification flags
through unchanged, for example `CC_FORCE_NIX=1 scripts/build.sh --all`.

For faster iteration or to retain earlier Cargo variants, use
`scripts/build.sh --keep-builds --fast` (or keep using the focused checks below).
Fresh builds recompile dependencies. The wrapper also defaults Rust development
and test debug symbols and incremental compilation off; explicit Cargo environment
overrides are respected. `--keep-builds` preserves caches, not executable snapshots.
Run builds sequentially within each checkout, and finish a task with a fresh run.
See [the agent build policy](CLAUDE.md#verifying) for details.

```bash
# Everything CI checks for Rust: fmt, clippy, build, test
scripts/verify.sh

# Just the fast pair, for a tight loop
scripts/verify.sh --fast

# One crate, one test
scripts/verify.sh -p core worktree_add

# Add the client lanes (dart format, flutter analyze, flutter test, cdylib)
scripts/verify.sh --client

# Everything CI runs, plus shellcheck, script self-tests and the Flutter e2e
scripts/verify.sh --all

# Run the TUI with debug logging to /tmp/claude-commander.log
scripts/dev-run.sh tui --debug
```

`verify.sh` runs every selected check even after one fails, keeps full output
under `target/verify-logs/`, and exits with the failing lane's own code (10 fmt,
11 clippy, 12 build, 13 test, …) — see `scripts/verify.sh --list`. Its lane list
mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, so a green `--all` means a green PR (modulo
toolchain drift — see below).

One thing to expect from `--all`: it is a *superset* of CI, also running
`shellcheck`, the script self-tests, and the Flutter `e2e` that CI cannot — so a
red lane there needn't mean red CI. The `e2e` lane needs a display; it reports
`SKIP` (not a failure) when there is neither one nor `xvfb-run`.

By default the lanes use whatever `cargo`/`flutter` is already on your `PATH` and
only re-enter the Nix dev shell when the tool is missing, so a local toolchain
that differs from the flake's can disagree with CI in either direction. Set
`CC_FORCE_NIX=1` to make every lane go through `nix develop` the way CI does.
`scripts/dev-run.sh` covers the launch side (TUI, server, Linux app, Android
emulator + APK deploy); both are documented in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md#commands).

**Golden images are the one case where the default toolchain rule is not good
enough.** The client's reference images under `client/test/goldens/` are
rasteriser-sensitive, so a `flutter test` from a differing local Flutter can pass
against images CI will reject. Any change that adds, regenerates or deletes a
golden must be verified with the pinned toolchain before pushing:

```bash
CC_FORCE_NIX=1 scripts/verify.sh --goldens          # check them
CC_FORCE_NIX=1 scripts/verify.sh --goldens --update # regenerate, then read the diff
```

See the Golden tests section of [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for what that does and
does not prove — a green run is strong evidence, not proof.

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run `cargo fmt` and
`cargo clippy` on every commit, plus `dart format` when the commit touches Dart.
After cloning, run `pre-commit install`.

The Dart hook shells out to `client/tool/dart-format.sh`, which re-enters the
client dev shell if `dart` isn't already on your `PATH` — so it works whether or
not you're inside `nix develop .#client`. The same script backs CI's Format Dart
step (`--check`), so the two can't drift.

### Screenshots

The images in `docs/images/` are **generated**, not hand-captured: both capture
scripts render one hermetic demo workspace (three projects, ten sessions, two PR
stacks, a stand-in agent) so nothing of yours leaks into a screenshot and the
terminal and client images stay consistent. Regenerate after a UI change with
`docs/tool/capture-tui.sh` or
`nix develop .#clientCi -c docs/tool/capture-client.sh`; see
[`docs/tool/README.md`](docs/tool/README.md).

### Architecture

The TUI event loop (`App`) owns the terminal and render state. It sends user commands to a `SessionManager` which coordinates tmux and git operations via async channels. Git read operations use gitoxide (pure Rust); worktree mutations and tmux use CLI subprocesses with semaphore-based throttling.
