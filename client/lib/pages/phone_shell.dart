/// The phone root: a two-tab shell over the Fleet list and the Activity feed,
/// with a prominent centre action that starts a new session. Both tabs are kept
/// alive in an [IndexedStack] so switching preserves each view's scroll position,
/// search text, and filter state.
///
/// The frame itself comes from [ChromeShell], because the two themes build it
/// very differently — Mission Control docks a `FloatingActionButton` over a
/// `BottomAppBar`, while LCARS has neither and renders a run of contiguous footer
/// blocks instead. This page only says *what* the destinations are.
///
/// Settings hangs off the shell rather than off the Fleet view that used to carry
/// it, so it is reachable from either tab — and, in LCARS, so the footer owns the
/// frame's bottom-left corner instead of the rail terminating above it.
///
/// Reuses the same layout-agnostic bodies as the wide shell — [SessionListBody]
/// (with its branded Fleet header enabled) and [ActivityBody] — and the shared
/// [openSessionDetail] / [openCreateSession] / [openSettings] helpers, so
/// navigation, session creation, and settings all behave as they do elsewhere.
