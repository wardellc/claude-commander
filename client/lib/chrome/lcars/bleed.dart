/// shell/page and the wide shell — bleed identically, and a second copy of any
/// of it would be a second thing to keep in step.
///
/// Note what is deliberately *not* here any more: a fill that closed the gaps
/// between bled columns so the band behind the status bar read as one solid
/// mass. It kept the black out of the system clock, which on a Pixel 8a sat
/// right on the phone frame's rail/content seam — but a closed gap leaves an
/// elbow cap's bottom-left radius nothing to curve out of, so the caps squared
/// and the frame turned its corners at a bare 90°. Asked to choose between a
/// notch through the band and a square corner, the user took the notch, and
/// the fill went. The rail then moved 62 -> 70dp so that notch clears the
/// status-bar clock rather than cutting a digit in half — the measurement is
/// on [CommanderTokens.railWidth].
