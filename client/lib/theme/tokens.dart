  /// at `railWidth`..`railWidth + 5` in the status bar gets a black bar through
  /// it. At the deck's 62 that was the clock's last digit, sliced vertically in
  /// half.
  ///
  /// Where the clock ends is **device-specific, and not a fixed width**. Do not
  /// calibrate this on an emulator: an emulator at 1080x2400 / 420dpi draws the

  /// 73 is set against the device numbers, and the margin is deliberately thin

  /// maximise clearance. It puts the gutter at 73-78dp, which clears a
  /// '14:20'-shaped clock (ends 70.9dp) by 2.1dp, and a narrower time (ends
  /// 66.7dp) by 6.3dp. An all-wide-digit time ('00:00', '08:00', '20:08')
  /// extrapolates from the widths above to about 77.7dp — inside the gutter,
  /// so at those times the last digit is clipped. That extrapolation has not
  /// been confirmed against a real clock reading 00:00; treat it as the known
  /// limit of this value rather than a measured fact.

  /// in an ~8dp gap whose position moves with the clock string, so no fixed
  /// width is ever a guarantee — only a calibration, and only for an HH:MM
