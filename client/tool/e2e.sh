# Full-stack e2e runner: boot a HERMETIC claude-commander-server over throwaway
# state, then drive the real Flutter app against it with the integration_test
# suite on the Linux desktop target.
#
# Hermetic by construction:
#   * XDG_CONFIG_HOME / XDG_DATA_HOME are redirected into a mktemp'd tree, so the
#     server's config.toml, state.json AND its default worktrees dir
#     ($XDG_DATA_HOME/claude-commander/worktrees) all live under $TMP. The real
#     ~/.config and ~/.local/share are never touched (the `directories` crate
#     honours XDG on Linux).
#   * The server binds loopback with a fixed pre-shared token and a fresh git
#     repo to branch sessions from.
# Everything is torn down on exit (server killed, $TMP removed).
#
# Run from the client dir inside the nix client shell, e.g.:
#   nix develop .#client   -c client/tool/e2e.sh     # local (has a display)
#   nix develop .#clientCi -c xvfb-run client/tool/e2e.sh   # CI (headless)
#
# Requires: flutter (linux desktop), cargo, git, tmux on PATH.
