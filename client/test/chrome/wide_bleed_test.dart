/// The wide LCARS frame's safe-area treatment.
///
/// It is a *different* frame from the phone shell — three columns rather than
/// two, each opening with a block that bleeds into the status bar: the nav
/// rail's identifier and an elbow cap over each of the fleet and detail
/// columns. The detail column's cap is easy to forget, because the implementation
/// once lacked it and this doc described that state; 'the detail column
/// carries a cap of its own' below is what pins it now.
///
/// The three-column layout needs a surface past `kLcarsThreeColumnWidth`
/// (1180dp), which no phone reaches — it is the desktop shape, where the insets
/// are zero and every assertion here degenerates to today's layout. The folded
/// two-column shape is the one a phone in landscape actually gets.
