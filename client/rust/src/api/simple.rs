//! Route API exposed to Flutter via flutter_rust_bridge.
//!
//! Every `pub fn` here becomes an async-callable function on the Dart side (frb
//! runs the Rust body on a worker thread). They all drive a
//! [`claude_commander_client::RemoteClient`] resolved from the opaque server
//! `handle` (see [`crate::api::registry`]); the transport, auth, ret/timeout, and
//! error classification all live in that shared crate, so this module is a thin
//! handle-resolve → call → DTO-convert layer.
//!
//! The two `health*` probes are the exception: the connect screen calls them
//! *before* a handle exists, so they build a throwaway client from the raw
//! URL/token.
