//! Diff **layout** exposed to Flutter: raw unified diff in, rows of styled runs
//! out.
//!
//! [`crate::api::review`] carries the review *data* (files, comments, reviewed
//! marks). This module carries its *presentation*, and it is where the Flutter
//! client stops hand-rolling a renderer: [`diffgrid`] parses the diff, word-diffs
//! it, lays it out inline or side by side, expands elided context, and emits
//! runs tagged with a semantic [role](diffgrid::style::Role). The TUI renders
//! through exactly the same pipeline, so the two frontends cannot drift apart
//! about what a diff *is* — only about what colours they paint it in.
//!
//! ## Stateless by design
//!
//! Layout is rebuilt per request. A cache of two raw reviews (at most 8 MiB
//! of source keys) reuses parsing across file switches, mode flips and gap
//! expansion. Exact input keys keep changed reviews fresh. Dart holds returned
//! rows while scrolling. Expansion
//! state travels as a replayable list of [`DiffExpansion`]s for the same reason.
//!
//! ## Why the DTOs are flat
//!
//! Same rule as [`crate::api::review`]: frb renders data-carrying Rust enums as
//! Dart `freezed` classes, which needs build_runner. So `Role::Gutter(origin)`
//! flattens away entirely (the gutter is a Flutter widget, not text — see
//! [`content_gutter`]) and every enum that crosses is a unit enum.
