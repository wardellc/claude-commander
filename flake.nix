        # The other two branches are the same problem from the Apple-build side.
        # The Nix apple-sdk carries the macOS SDK *only*, so any request for
        # another Apple platform has to go to the host's Xcode: cc-rs asks
        # `xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk iphoneos` for its sysroot, and that is
        # exactly where the `aarch64-apple-ios` staticlib build stops otherwise.
        # And because the stub only understands the Nix SDK's layout, a
        # DEVELOPER_DIR pointing at a real Xcode has to be handed off as well.
        #
        # DEVELOPER_DIR/SDKROOT are cleared before delegating: the host xcrun
        # reads them too, and the shell's values would send it back into the Nix
        # SDK it cannot make sense of.
        #
        # Everything else in `clientXcodeEnvScrub` goes for a different reason.
        # `xcodebuild` reads the *process environment* as build-setting
        # overrides: any variable whose name is a build setting silently beats
        # the value in the project. The Nix stdenv exports a whole toolchain
        # under exactly those names, so merely entering this shell rewrites the
        # Runner's build settings. `LD` is the one with teeth — Xcode links
        # through the clang driver, and `LD=ld` sends clang-driver flags to
        # ld64 instead, so the build dies in a pod with
        #   ld: -objc_abi_version '-Xlinker' not supported (expected 2)
        # which names neither Nix nor the variable that caused it. Both
        # deployment targets go too: Xcode sets whichever one its platform
        # needs, and the other one, left over from the shell, is "conflicting
        # deployment targets, both 'MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET' and
        # 'IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET' are present in environment".
        #
        # Scrubbed per delegation rather than at shell entry, because these are
        # also how a plain `cargo build` finds Nix's toolchain — only Xcode
        # mistakes them for build settings. The iOS deployment floor that
        # `cargo build` needs (see IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET below) therefore
