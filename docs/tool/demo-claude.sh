# Stand-in agent for the README screenshot fixture: paints a plausible Claude
# Code transcript into the pane, then parks. Never runs a real agent — the
# screenshots must be reproducible and must not spend tokens.
#
# The fixture links this in as `claude`, which is load-bearing twice over. The
# *name* is what makes the app treat the session as a Claude harness at all
# (`AgentKind::from_program` matches the program's basename exactly, and the state
# detector skips panes whose harness it doesn't recognise). And being launched as
# a bare `claude`, with no arguments, is what keeps the client's session header
# reading like a real setup instead of showing a temp-dir path.
#
# So the per-session detail arrives out of band: each session's row in the
# fixture's manifest, keyed by worktree directory name. The manifest sits next to
# the worktrees, which is the one path this script can derive from its own cwd —
# the app starts the agent *in* its worktree. The fixture writes a session's row
# just after creating it, so the wait below is normally over in a moment.
#
# Manifest row: <worktree name>\t<mode>\t<task>\t<detail>, where mode picks the
# state the detector will report:
#
#   working  — quadrant-circle spinner in the pane title
#              (`AgentKind::title_state`), the frame real Claude Code animates
#   waiting  — permission prompt containing "Esc to cancel"
#              (`claude_content_state`)
#   idle     — ordinary transcript, no prompt markers
#   echo     — interactive: echoes typed lines and reports resizes (web e2e only)
#
# Every line is kept under ~46 columns so the transcript doesn't soft-wrap in the
# narrowest place it is shown: the client's phone-width terminal.
