# Configuration

Configuration, theming, section grouping, and data-storage paths for Claude
Commander. For installation and the keyboard / status-symbol reference, see the
[README](../README.md). For the usage guide, see [Usage](usage.md).

Configuration file location depends on your platform:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.claude-commander.claude-commander/config.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude-commander/config.toml`

```toml
# Selectable agent harnesses for the New Session dialog's program picker. Each
# entry pairs a display `label` with the `command` launched (program plus any
# flags); the command's first token determines the harness, so Claude Code
# (`claude`), OpenAI Codex (`codex`), OpenCode (`opencode`) and Oh My Pi (`omp`)
# are all recognised and get the right launch, resume, and working/waiting
# detection. Anything else is launched as-is, with no such handling — a bare
# shell is a valid entry. The first entry is the default
# for new sessions. When `programs` is omitted, the picker offers a single
# built-in `claude` entry.
#
# Legacy configs using `default_program = "..."` are migrated automatically:
# the legacy command is moved or inserted as the first `[[programs]]` entry and
# `default_program` is removed from the file.
#
# In the New Session dialog, press Tab (or Shift+Tab to go back) to cycle focus
# between the name field, the project picker, and the program picker, then ↑/↓
# to choose. The project picker defaults to the currently-selected project and
# can be typed into to filter the list — so the usual "type a name, hit Enter"
# flow is unchanged.
#
# Program entries can be managed in-app from Settings ▸ Programs (settings
# modal, `,` key) — add (`n`), rename (`r`), edit the label/command fields, and
# remove (`d`) entries, or reorder them with `J`/`K`. Reordering changes the
# default, since the first entry is the default for new sessions.

# from the palette ("Add remote server" / "Remove remote server", which
# includes a connection test) or by hand here — the file is hot-reloaded.
# These are a list-of-tables, so unlike the scalar options above they are
# NOT editable from the in-app settings modal; use the palette commands.
# The name "local" is reserved for the built-in local machine.

```

A remote server's `token` is **operator-equivalent**: anyone holding it can create
sessions (which run arbitrary programs on that machine) and address projects by
server-side path. Treat it like an SSH key — don't commit it, don't share it, and
scope it to people you'd give a shell. On disk this file is protected only by its
`0600` permissions, so keep those intact.

Don't add a remote server that shares this machine's `state.json` (for example a
loopback `http://localhost:7878` server backed by the same data directory as your
local instance). Its sessions are already shown under the local machine, so they
would appear twice — once under the local root and once under the server header —
and rows under the server header could be misrouted to the local backend. A
loopback server is fine only when it runs against a **separate** data directory.
claude-commander logs a warning when a configured server's URL is a loopback
address as a reminder.

## Idle-session hibernation

Each live session holds a `claude` process open in tmux (~400MB RAM) whether or
not you're using it. With many sessions open, idle ones waste memory. When
`hibernate_enabled = true`, a background loop stops the tmux process of any
session that has been idle past `hibernate_idle_timeout_secs`, **keeping its
worktree, branch, and metadata** — only the process is stopped. The session
shows as `Stopped` and transparently resumes (with `--resume`, so the
conversation is preserved) the next time you attach.

A session counts as **idle** only when all of these hold:

- its agent is `Idle` — a `Working`, `WaitingForInput` (pending approval), or
  momentarily undetectable session is never hibernated;
- no tmux client is attached to it, and it wasn't attached within the last
  check interval or 30 seconds, whichever is longer (so recent attaches are
  protected slightly longer when the check interval is set below 30s);
- `keep_alive` is off for that session.

**Waking is automatic**: attaching (`Enter`) recreates the tmux session and
resumes the agent, even if `resume_session = false` globally — hibernation
always resumes, since that's what makes it non-destructive.

**Keeping a session alive**: run the **Toggle keep-alive** action from the
command palette on a session (or `claude-commander keep-alive <session>
[--on|--off]`) to exempt it from hibernation — useful for a long-running build,
a watched log, or anything you want to keep warm. A kept-alive session shows an
anchor (`⚓`) marker on the board. The action has no default hotkey; bind
one via `toggle_keep_alive` under `[keybindings]` (e.g. `toggle_keep_alive =
["K"]`) if you want a shortcut. The flag persists across restarts.

Enabling hibernation and changing `hibernate_check_interval_secs` are
restart-required (the loop is spawned once at launch); `hibernate_idle_timeout_secs`
is read live.

## Conversation mode (TTS)

Press **`Alt-c`** to open a full-screen **conversation overlay** — a chat with a dedicated
Claude session whose replies **stream in and are spoken aloud** through any **OpenAI-compatible**
TTS engine (it posts to `{base_url}/audio/speech`). Type a message, press Enter; the reply is
spoken sentence-by-sentence *as it's generated*. Closing the overlay (Esc / `Alt-c`) leaves the
session running, so the conversation continues where you left off.

This session is **separate from the commander** (`Shift-C`) and unrelated to it. It's driven over
Claude Code's stream-json protocol (`claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format
stream-json --include-partial-messages`), which is the supported way to get clean token-level
text — so TTS can start within a sentence of Claude beginning to type, rather than waiting for the
whole reply. A new message interrupts in-flight speech. If the TTS server is unreachable, the chat
still works (text-only) and never blocks the UI.

`enabled` is the master switch for the whole feature and is **off by default** — set it (in
Settings ▸ Conversation or config) before `Alt-c` will open the overlay. We develop against a
local [Kokoro](https://github.com/sizeak/kokoro-tts-rocm) container (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8002/v1`), but any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works.

```toml
[conversation]
enabled = true                          # speak replies via TTS (off = text-only chat)
command = "claude"                       # binary for the conversation session
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8002/v1"   # OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint (include /v1)
model = "kokoro"                         # TTS model name (engines serving one model ignore it)
voice = "af_sky"                         # omit to use the server's default voice
response_format = "wav"                  # wav | mp3 | opus | flac (wav = lowest local latency)
speed = 1.0                              # 0.25–4.0
speak_scope = "prose_only"               # prose_only | verbatim
volume = 1.0                             # 0.0–2.0
```

`speak_scope` controls what's spoken (applied per sentence as it streams):

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `prose_only` (default) | Strip code blocks and markdown; speak the natural-language prose |
| `verbatim` | Speak the text unchanged |

> **Build note:** in-process playback (`rodio`) and microphone capture (`cpal`) use **PipeWire** as
> the default audio host on Linux (falling back to **ALSA** at runtime if PipeWire isn't running),
> so both backends are linked. They're gated behind the `audio` cargo feature, which is **on by
> default** — so building the TUI (`claude-commander`) from source needs the PipeWire and ALSA
> development libraries plus **clang/libclang** (cpal's PipeWire backend runs `bindgen`):
> `libpipewire-0.3-dev libasound2-dev libclang-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `pipewire alsa-lib clang` on
> Arch. The default Nix dev shell provides them automatically. The headless server and the Flutter
> client build with `audio` off (`default-features = false`) and never link either backend — remote
> clients do capture/playback on-device instead.

## Voice input (STT)

Press **`Alt-v`** to talk to the conversation agent. It's a **toggle**: the first press starts
recording the microphone, the next press stops it, transcribes the audio through any
**OpenAI-compatible** speech-to-text engine (it posts a WAV to `{base_url}/audio/transcriptions`),
and sends the resulting text to the conversation session — exactly as if you'd typed it. The reply
then streams back and is spoken aloud (if TTS is enabled). Voice input works **whether the overlay
is open or not**, mirroring spoken replies.

`stt.enabled` is a separate switch from `conversation.enabled` and is **off by default**. Voice
input feeds the conversation session, so it's only useful alongside conversation mode. Microphone
capture uses `cpal` (PipeWire/ALSA on Linux — see the build note above). If no microphone is available
or the STT server is unreachable, voice input degrades gracefully (a status message) and never
blocks the UI.

```toml
[stt]
enabled = true                          # master switch for Alt-v voice input (off = no voice input)
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"   # OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint (include /v1)
model = "Systran/faster-whisper-base"    # transcription model name
language = "en"                          # ISO-639-1 hint; omit to auto-detect
# prompt = "Vitest, Kotlin, ..."         # optional decoding prompt (domain vocab / spelling hints)
# api_key = "..."                        # sent as a Bearer header; omit for local servers
# input_device = "alsa_input.pci-0000_c1_00.6.analog-stereo"  # device id; omit for the system default
pause_media = true                       # pause other players while recording, resume after the reply
```

`input_device` picks which microphone to capture from — omit it (or leave it as **(default)**
in Settings ▸ Conversation) to use the system default. Set it from the **STT Microphone** picker
in the settings modal, which lists each device by a friendly name; monitor/loopback sources (e.g.
recording your speakers) are tagged **(loopback)**. The value stored is cpal's stable device *id*
(the PipeWire `node.name`, e.g. `alsa_input.pci-…`), not the friendly name — because a mic and its
speaker's loopback can share a name, so ids are what uniquely identify a device. If the configured
device isn't present when recording starts, capture falls back to the default (with a warning)
rather than failing. Selecting a microphone takes effect on the **next recording, live** — no
restart needed — whenever voice input is already running.

While you're recording (and until the assistant has finished its spoken reply), `pause_media`
pauses any other media players so they don't talk over the conversation, then resumes whatever was
playing once things go quiet. It's best-effort — `playerctl` on Linux, `osascript` (Spotify/Music)
on macOS — and a silent no-op when neither is available, so it never blocks or breaks voice input.
On by default; set to `false` to leave your media alone.

Audio is captured at the microphone's native rate, downmixed to mono, and encoded as 16-bit PCM
WAV; the server resamples as needed. Recording isn't chunked yet — the whole utterance is uploaded
when you stop — so very long dictations wait until the end to transcribe.

### Global voice hotkey

`Alt-v` only fires when the terminal window is focused — a terminal app can't read key events
otherwise. To toggle voice input from **anywhere on the desktop**, bind a desktop-level global
shortcut to the `listen-toggle` command:

```sh
claude-commander listen-toggle          # toggle (also: --start / --stop)
```

This connects to the running TUI over a per-user Unix socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-commander.sock`, falling back to the OS temp dir on macOS) and toggles
recording exactly as `Alt-v` would — and it works even while you're attached to a session. The
socket server starts automatically when the TUI launches with `stt.enabled = true`; the command
prints `recording`/`stopped` and exits non-zero (with a message) if no TUI is running.

- **KDE Plasma / Linux:** System Settings ▸ Shortcuts ▸ **Add ▸ Command or Script**, set the command
  to `claude-commander listen-toggle`, and assign your key. Pick a combo **different from `Alt-v`** so
  the global grab doesn't shadow the in-app binding.
- **macOS:** bind the same command via skhd, Karabiner-Elements, Raycast, or Shortcuts.app.

> A command shortcut is used (rather than the in-process XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal) because the
> portal can't assign a non-sandboxed terminal binary a stable app identity, so the compositor never
> persists a reliably-bindable shortcut for it. The command route has no such limitation.

Both this and in-app `Alt-v` feed the same recording state, so they stay consistent. Only one running
TUI instance owns the socket; a second instance logs and skips.

## Theme Presets

Set `preset` under `[theme]` in your config to switch the entire color palette:

```toml
[theme]
preset = "rose-pine"
```

Available presets:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `basic` | 16-color ANSI (maximum compatibility) |
| `indexed` | 256-color palette |
| `truecolor` | 24-bit Catppuccin-inspired pastels (default on capable terminals) |
| `monokai-dimmed` | Muted/desaturated Monokai — dark grays with soft gold, green, and blue accents |
| `zedokai` | Vibrant Monokai variant inspired by the Zed editor — vivid pink, green, and orange |
| `rose-pine` | Soft pink/rose aesthetic — deep navy-rose backgrounds with warm rose, iris, and foam accents |
| `lcars` | Star Trek: TNG console palette — black canvas with amber, lilac, periwinkle and salmon accents on tan text. The peer of the mobile/desktop client's LCARS theme |

The four named presets (`monokai-dimmed`, `zedokai`, `rose-pine`, `lcars`) are
24-bit palettes and need a **truecolor** terminal; on a 16- or 256-color terminal
their colors will be approximated by the terminal itself. Use `basic` or `indexed`
there instead.

Two things are specific to `lcars`. Its status bar is solid amber with black text
rather than a dark band, and since `status_bar_bg` also drives the tmux status line
(`status-style`), that amber bar appears in attached sessions too — override
`status_bar_bg` / `status_bar_fg` if you would rather it stayed dark. Its Working
spinner is a solid amber instead of the cycling rainbow every other preset uses;
set `agent_working = "rainbow"` to get the rainbow back.

When `preset` is unset (or `"(auto)"`), the theme auto-detects your terminal's color capability.

### Status bar accent

The highlighted hotkey letter in `[n]ew session` and the board's top-bar title are
drawn **on** the status bar, so they get their own colour, `status_bar_accent`,
rather than the canvas-tuned `text_accent`:

```toml
[theme]
status_bar_accent = "#2e2e5c"
```

Every preset whose bar is dark sets this to the same value it already used, so the
appearance is unchanged. It exists because two presets could not: `lcars` has a
light amber bar where a lilac letter is barely legible, and `basic` drew a blue
letter on its own blue bar. Editable in-app from **Settings ▸ Theme ▸ Status Bar
Accent** (`,` key).

Individual color overrides (e.g. `border_focused = "#ff6600"`) still apply on top of the chosen preset.

### Light terminals

Every preset above is designed for a **dark** terminal background. On a light one, declare it:

```toml
[theme]
appearance = "light"   # "dark" (default) | "light"
```

This does not swap the palette — it changes the surface that *derived fills* are blended against.
The review diff view (`R`) builds its add/remove line bands by scaling the theme's diff colours
toward the background; scaling toward black on a light terminal produces a near-black band under
dark text. With `appearance = "light"` those bands blend toward white instead, so they read as a
pale green/red wash.

Nothing detects this for you — querying the terminal background (`OSC 11`) is deliberately out of
scope — so it is a claim you make about your own terminal. Leaving it unset keeps whatever the
preset declares, which is `dark` for all of them. Editable in-app from **Settings ▸ Theme ▸
Appearance** (`,` key); clear the field to fall back to the preset.

## Session List Sections

Sections are the **columns** of the [board](../README.md#board). Each configured section becomes one column, and a session's card lands in the first column whose predicate it matches.

Sections drive both the **board** columns and the section-grouped **list** views
(`v` cycles project list → Sections → Section Stacks → board). When `[[sections]]`
is empty, the board shows three baked-in default columns assigned automatically
from the selected provider's review state — **In Progress** (the catch-all),
**In Review** (open PR/MR), and **Merged** (merged PR/MR) — and the list stays
project-grouped. Declaring any
`[[sections]]` **replaces** the board defaults with your own columns and makes the
section list views meaningful; nothing is written back to `config.toml`.

An implicit **"In Progress"** section is always the first column / group and acts
as the catch-all — any session whose PR state doesn't match a later section's
predicate lands here. It also accounts for every project that hasn't placed a
session into a later column, so newly added projects stay visible.

The two section list views differ in how they treat stacks. The **Section
Stacks** layout (the default once sections are configured) keeps each
[PR stack](usage.md#pr-stacks) together as a unit under the section chosen by its
base (the stack root), with children nested under their base — so a draft session
stacked on top never drags the whole stack out of the base's section. The plain
**Sections** layout drops that nesting — ordering follows the section rules, so a
base and its child may land in different sections depending on their PR state. On
the board a stack is a run of contiguous cards that moves between columns as a
unit, its base and children always sharing one column. In every view the
underlying stack links are still tracked and the `t` hotkey still stacks new
sessions onto the top.

### Example

This mirrors a label-driven code review workflow: author adds `dev-review-required` when the PR is ready, a reviewer removes the label and picks it up, the PR gets approved and merged.

```toml
[[sections]]
name = "Needs Review"
has_label = "dev-review-required"

[[sections]]
name = "In Review"
pr_state = "open"          # scope to open PRs — otherwise merged PRs
has_reviewer = true        # with reviewers would also match here

[[sections]]
name = "Merged"
pr_state = ["merged", "closed"]

[[sections]]
name = "Stale"             # no predicates → manual-only waypoint
```

Each section is a column on the board and the leftmost column is the project
sidebar. Each session is its own card, titled with its number and name and
coloured by project; the interior line carries the status glyph and the
`[>_] [±] [i]` action buttons.

```
 Projects    │ In Progress (12)     │ Needs Review (1)     │ In Review (2)
 terraform 4 │ ╭ 1 session-a ─────╮ │ ╭ 5 fix-dns-spam ──╮ │ ╭ 6 new-metrics ───╮
 genio     3 │ │ ●      [>_][±][i]│ │ │ ●      [>_][±][i]│ │ │ ●      [>_][±][i]│
             │ ╰──────────────────╯ │ ╰──────────────────╯ │ ╰──────────────────╯
             │ ╭ 2 session-b ─────╮ │                      │ ╭ 7 add-ela… ──────╮
             │ │ ●      [>_][±][i]│ │                      │ │ ●      [>_][±][i]│
             │ ╰──────────────────╯ │                      │ ╰──────────────────╯
```

### Predicate fields

All fields are optional; a section matches when **every declared field** matches (AND). A section declared with no predicates is a **manual-only waypoint** — auto-matching never puts sessions there; you only move in via the palette.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pr_state` | `"open"` \| `"closed"` \| `"merged"` — scalar or array (any-of) | |
| `is_draft` | `bool` | |
| `has_pr` | `bool` | |
| `has_label` | string (literal) or array (any-of) | |
| `review_decision` | `"approved"` \| `"changes_requested"` \| `"review_required"` — scalar or array (any-of) | Mirrors GitHub's `reviewDecision`; GitLab leaves it unset in this release |
| `has_reviewer` | `true` / `false`, a specific login, or an array of logins (any-of) | `true` excludes Copilot via case-insensitive `"copilot"` substring match; specific/array forms match literally |
| `max_sessions` | positive integer | Advisory WIP limit. Section header shows `count/limit`, warning-coloured at the limit and error-coloured over it. Never blocks creation. |

### Process order and forward-only

Config order is the pipeline. A session's section is re-evaluated on every PR refresh, but the scan **only considers sections at or after the session's current position** — auto never moves a session backwards. This keeps `"Needs Review"` sticky when a reviewer removes the label without leaving other signals; the session doesn't slide back to `"In Progress"`.

### Moving sessions manually

Select a session and press `m` (or open the palette with `Space`, or `Shift+Space` for commands-only, and run **Move session to section…**), then pick a target. An **Auto** entry clears an existing pin. The override is persisted to `state.json` and survives restarts; auto-moves are suppressed until the pin is released.

### Creating sessions inside a section

On the board, a session created with `n` lands in the column the cursor was in, not the "In Progress" catch-all. For a manual-only waypoint (no predicates) this sets the same pin as a manual move; for a predicate-bearing section it's a soft placement — the session starts there but still auto-advances through the pipeline as its PR progresses. Creating from "In Progress" keeps the default behaviour. The CLI's `claude-commander new --section` flag follows the same rules.

### WIP limits

Set `max_sessions = N` on any section to flag it when it accumulates too much work. The header renders `count/N`, switching to the warning colour when `count == N` and to the error colour when `count > N`. The catch-all "In Progress" section uses the top-level `in_progress_limit` instead:

```toml
in_progress_limit = 3

[[sections]]
name = "In Review"
pr_state = "open"
has_reviewer = true
max_sessions = 5
```

Limits are advisory — they never block session creation or section transitions. Sessions still flow through the pipeline as their PRs progress.

### Reordering, adding, or removing sections

These are edit-`config.toml`-and-restart actions — there's no hot reload. The cached `current_section` on each session is reconciled against the new config on next startup; if the referenced section no longer exists, the session falls back to `"In Progress"` and continues forward-only from there.

## Usage Telemetry

Claude Commander reports anonymous **feature-usage** telemetry so we can see which
features are used and retire the ones that aren't. It is **on by default** and
**opt-out**.

**What is sent:** the name of each feature you use (e.g. `review.open`,
`session.create`), a coarse environment fingerprint (OS, architecture, terminal
program, shell *name*, terminal colour mode), a non-sensitive config snapshot
(theme preset, whether custom sections are configured, which optional features
are enabled), the frontend name + version, the library version, and a random,
resettable install id.

**What is never sent:** typed text, prompts, Claude session content, comment
bodies, branch/session names, repository paths, command arguments, or arbitrary
environment variables. The event schema is a fixed set of typed fields — there
is no code path that forwards free-form text.

**To disable**, either set the config flag:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false

# Self-hosters can point telemetry at their own OpenObserve instead:
# endpoint = "https://o2.example.com/api/<org>/<stream>/_json"
# token = "<base64 of \"email:token\">"   # HTTP Basic credential
```

…or export the standard [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com/) variable
(any non-empty, non-`0` value), which disables it regardless of config:

```sh
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

The ingest credential is committed in the source tree, so **all** builds —
including ones compiled from source — report by default. Distro packagers who
want telemetry compiled out entirely can build with an empty token:

```sh
CC_TELEMETRY_TOKEN="" cargo build --release
```
