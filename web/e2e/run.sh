#
# Browser e2e for the web UI: builds a hermetic commander world, starts the
# server (which serves the page itself), and runs the Playwright suite
# (web/e2e/*.spec.ts) against it headless.
#
# Usage: web/e2e/run.sh [--no-build] [playwright test args...]
#   e.g. web/e2e/run.sh --grep review
#
#   --no-build   use the existing target/debug binary instead of building
#
# Exit status: Playwright's (0 all passed, 1 failures or bad Playwright args),
# 3 missing toolchain / version mismatch, 4 fixture setup failed.
#
# Hermetic by construction — it reuses docs/tool/fixture.sh, whose
# cc_fixture_env puts config/state/worktrees under a temp tree, points
# TMUX_TMPDIR there AND unsets $TMUX/$TMUX_PANE (without which tmux resolves the
# developer's real server and the cleanup's kill-server would nuke it), stubs gh
# and exports DO_NOT_TRACK=1. The trap tears the whole tree down on any exit.
#
# Toolchain: re-enters `nix develop .#web` unless already inside it (probed by
# PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH, which only that shell sets). An ambient node is not
# enough: the browsers must be nixpkgs' pinned build, since Playwright's own
# download can't run on NixOS and would differ from what CI runs anyway.
# CC_WEB_SHELL overrides the shell ref. The server is built with the ambient
# cargo, else the default dev shell.
#
# The page under test is whatever crates/claude-commander-server/webui/ holds:
# a debug build of the server reads it from disk, so rebuild it first
# (`npm run build`) when testing a change to web/src. Beware --no-build after
# `cargo test -p claude-commander-server`: that rebuilds target/debug's server
# binary with the crate's dev-only `debug-embed` feature, which bakes the page
# in as it was then — the suite would silently test a stale page.
#
# The suite itself only knows the page's origin and token (CC_WEB_BASE_URL,
# CC_WEB_TOKEN); where the page comes from is decided here, in serve_page.
