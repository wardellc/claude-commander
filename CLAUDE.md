# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

**Use `scripts/verify.sh` and `scripts/dev-run.sh` rather than improvising the underlying commands.** They exist because the raw invocations were being retyped — and subtly varied — hundreds of times: an audit of this repo's session history found 1,033 `cargo` calls, 407 `flutter` calls (335 of them hand-wrapped in `nix develop .#client…`) and 205 `adb` calls, with the same six-step Android chain reassembled from memory each time. The scripts encode the correct form once. Reach for a raw command only when doing something the scripts do not cover, and if it's something you'll want twice, add a lane or target instead.

### Verifying

`scripts/verify.sh`'s lanes mirror `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, so a green `--all` means a green PR. `--all` is a *superset* of CI, though: it also runs `shellcheck`, the script `selftest`, and the `e2e` that CI cannot. A red lane there does not imply red CI.

- `scripts/verify.sh` — the Rust lanes: fmt, clippy, build, test
- `scripts/verify.sh --fast` — fmt + clippy only (seconds; the pre-commit hook's shape)
- `scripts/verify.sh --client` — Rust lanes plus pub get / dart format / flutter analyze / flutter test / cdylib tests
- `scripts/verify.sh --all` — every CI job, plus shellcheck, the script self-tests, and the Flutter e2e
- `scripts/verify.sh --nix` — Rust lanes plus the flake src-filter guard, `nix build` and the Homebrew-path packaging install
- `scripts/verify.sh --web` — the browser UI alone: `web` (npm ci, biome check, typecheck, `node --test`, a rebuild that must leave the committed `webui/` unchanged, and protocol's `--features ts` drift test) then `web-e2e` (`web/e2e/run.sh`, headless Playwright against a hermetic server). Both are also in `--all`, and — unlike the Flutter e2e — CI runs both
- `scripts/verify.sh -p core <filter>` — one crate: `cargo test -p claude-commander-core <filter>`. Aliases: `core`, `cli`/`commander`, `server`, `protocol`, `remote`, `client`, `test-support`
- `scripts/verify.sh --list` — the lane / exit-code table

Every selected lane runs even after an earlier one fails; output goes to `target/verify-logs/<lane>.log` and only a 40-line tail is printed on failure. **The process exits with the first failing lane's reserved code**, so you can tell what broke without reading logs: 10 fmt, 11 clippy, 12 build, 13 test, 20 pub-get, 21 dart-format, 22 analyze, 23 flutter-test, 24 cdylib, 25 e2e, 26 goldens, 27 web, 28 web-e2e, 30 nix-build, 31 packaging, 32 shellcheck, 33 selftest, 34 nix-src-filter. Plus 2 for bad arguments and 3 for a missing toolchain. The `e2e` lane reports `SKIP` with a reason when there's no display and no `xvfb-run` — CI has never been able to run it, so a local run is the only coverage the full stack gets (`--e2e` forces it).

The `pub-get` lane is a precondition, not a check, and it is load-bearing: `dart format` reads each file's language version from the nearest `.dart_tool/package_config.json`, and `client/rust_builder/cargokit/build_tool` is a *vendored* Dart package with its own `pubspec.yaml` and no `.dart_tool`. Against a stale package config the formatter falls back to a different language version and rewrites 15 vendored files — `dart-format` reports `120 files (15 changed)` locally where CI reports `0 changed`. So the client lanes resolve packages first, exactly as CI's Fetch Flutter Packages step does. If you ever see `dart-format` fail on files you didn't touch, that's this.

### Running

- `scripts/dev-run.sh tui [--debug]` — the TUI (`--debug` logs to `/tmp/claude-commander.log`)
- `scripts/dev-run.sh server [--port N] [--token T] [--isolated]` — the headless server. `--isolated` runs it over a throwaway XDG tree with `TMUX_TMPDIR` set and `$TMUX` unset, so a dev run cannot touch real state or the developer's tmux server
- `scripts/dev-run.sh web [--port N] [--token T]` — the web UI's edit loop: `npm run build -- --watch` beside `server --isolated`, printing the `http://127.0.0.1:N/#token=…` URL once the server answers. A debug build's rust-embed reads `webui/` from disk per request, so a browser reload shows the rebuild without a server restart. Ctrl-C stops both
- `scripts/dev-run.sh linux [--log FILE]` — the Flutter Linux desktop app
- `scripts/dev-run.sh android [--device SERIAL] [--release] [--no-launch] [--window]` — boots the AVD if no device is attached, builds the APK, installs with `-r -g`, launches, then greps logcat for startup crashes (a monkey launch reports success even when the app dies). Failures are located by exit code: 40 emulator boot, 41 APK build, 42 install, 43 launch
- `scripts/dev-run.sh emulator start|stop|status` — headless AVD lifecycle on its own

Both scripts resolve their own toolchain: they use the tool already on PATH, else re-enter the nix dev shell that provides it — the rule `client/tool/dart-format.sh` already followed. So they work from a bare terminal and cost nothing extra inside `nix develop .#client`. **The caveat is toolchain drift:** CI runs its Rust lanes under `nix develop -c`, so an ambient `cargo`/`clippy` of a different version can disagree with CI in either direction. Set `CC_FORCE_NIX=1` to route every lane through `nix develop` the way CI does. `CC_CLIENT_SHELL`, `CC_ANDROID_SHELL`, `CC_WEB_SHELL` and `CC_AVD` override the shell refs and AVD name; `CC_E2E_TIMEOUT` and `CC_WEB_E2E_TIMEOUT` bound the two e2e lanes (default 1800s / 1200s). The web lanes probe for `biome`, not `node` — an ambient nvm node is common and would skip the shell that supplies biome — and `web-e2e` always runs inside `.#web`, since only nixpkgs' Chromium is drivable on NixOS.

`verify.sh` exports `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` for its whole run — the same backstop `ci.yml` sets workflow-wide, because `cfg!(test)` only suppresses core's *own* unit tests and downstream crates' `cargo test`/`cargo run` would otherwise report to the live endpoint. A verification sweep is not usage. `dev-run.sh` deliberately does *not* set it for its non-isolated targets, which are genuine usage; `--isolated` does.

It also points `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` at a poisoned config (`cc_poisoned_gitconfig`: signing on, signer `false`), as do ci.yml's two test steps, so a test fixture that would sign a commit — and hang on a developer's locked 1Password signer — fails at once instead. Fixtures opt out through core's `git::fixture` helpers (`fixture_git`/`fixture_git_std`, `-c commit.gpgsign=false`), or `disable_signing_in_repo` when the code under test is what commits; never by disabling signing in production code. `claude-commander-test-support` cannot use those — it is a *normal* dependency of its dependents, so enabling core's `test-support` there unified it into every `cargo build --workspace` (telemetry off, `MockBackend` compiled in) — and carries its own `harness_git` over core's public `git_command()` instead. The `build` lane fails if `cargo tree -e normal,build,features -i claude-commander-core` ever shows `test-support` (`cc_tree_leaks_test_support`).

Shared logic lives in `scripts/lib/dev-common.sh`; its pure helpers are covered by `scripts/tests/run.sh` (plain bash assertions, no framework), which runs as the `selftest` lane. When you add a lane, add it to `cc_lanes_for_tier`, `cc_exit_code_for_lane` and `cc_lane_description` — the self-tests assert every lane has a distinct code that doesn't collide with the reserved statuses.

## Verification discipline

- Never pipe command output through `| tail` / `| head` when checking pass/fail — it masks exit codes. Use `set -o pipefail` or run the command bare and report the real exit status.
- Do not claim tests, CI, or builds are green unless you have the actual exit code / CI conclusion in front of you. If verification was blocked, say so explicitly instead of inferring success.
- After any rebase or merge, re-run a full build before declaring done (stale `crate::` paths and missing deps have broken builds repeatedly).
- Verify against the pinned toolchain, not your PATH. `scripts/verify.sh` uses whatever `cargo`/`flutter` is already on your `PATH` and only falls back to the dev shell when one is missing, so a local toolchain that differs from the flake's can disagree with CI in either direction. `CC_FORCE_NIX=1` routes every lane through `nix develop` the way CI does. This is **mandatory for golden changes** — see [Golden tests](#golden-tests).

## Workflow: TDD then review then merge

For every bug fix or behaviour change: (1) write a failing test that reproduces the issue, (2) implement the minimal fix, (3) run the full suite + lint + typecheck, (4) request a peer/Fable review and address findings, (5) open the PR with the required label, watch CI, merge only when all checks are green.

## Coding conventions

- Minimise duplication: extract shared logic into helpers or existing utility functions rather than repeating code across modules
- Use idiomatic Rust patterns: leverage the type system, enums, pattern matching, iterators, and the `?` operator; prefer `impl Into<T>` / `AsRef<T>` over concrete types in function signatures where it improves ergonomics
- Follow the existing error handling style: `thiserror` derive macros for error enums, `Result<T>` alias from `error.rs`
- When several fallible steps share the same cleanup-on-error (e.g. removing a half-created session), group them in a single `?`-scoped `async` block and handle the error once, rather than repeating the cleanup after each call. Adding a step then inherits the cleanup automatically. Note: clippy/rust-analyzer cannot catch this duplication — it is a review-time check.
- Use `tracing` macros (`info!`, `debug!`, `warn!`) for logging, not `println!` or `eprintln!` (except in CLI output paths in `main.rs`)
- Keep `main.rs` thin: it should wire CLI args to library calls and print output. Any logic worth testing belongs in `SessionManager`/library code where unit tests can reach it, not inline in `main.rs` (which is untestable without spawning the binary)
- **Core has no clap dependency, and must not gain one.** Defining a CLI is a binary's job: each binary owns its clap tree (`crates/claude-commander/src/cli_args.rs`, `crates/claude-commander-server/src/main.rs`) and an embedder of the library never inherits an argument parser it has no use for. This is also a correctness rule, not just tidiness — a clap derive takes its program name and version from the package it compiles in, so while `Cli` lived in core, `--version` printed `claude-commander-core` and the commander's generated CLI reference documented unrunnable `claude-commander-core <sub>` commands. Core takes the *rendered* markdown instead (`commander::ensure_session` takes a `cli_reference: &str`, `App::new` an owned `String`); `cli_args::cli_reference()` produces it.
- **Wire contracts live in `claude-commander-protocol`, and that includes limits — not just types.** If the server and its clients must agree on a *rule* (an accept allow-list, a size cap, a validation predicate), it belongs in protocol, not in core with clients duplicating it. Worked example: `protocol/src/paste.rs` owns `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, the `ImageFormat` allow-list and `validate` — one definition, enforced independently by the server's `DefaultBodyLimit` (`router.rs`), the service's up-front re-check (`api.rs`), `PasteImageStore::store`, `RemoteClient::paste_image`'s pre-upload check, the TUI's Ctrl+V size gate (`tmux/attach.rs`), and the Flutter client's file-length pre-check. Prefer a typed value over a stringly one when the contract *is* the allow-list: `validate` returns `ImageFormat`, whose `ext()`/`content_type()` make the accepted set exhaustive and unrepresentable-if-wrong, rather than an `&str` extension every caller has to re-interpret. The *effectful* half stays in core (`paste_image.rs`: RGBA→PNG encode, the pruned temp-file store, the pane injection). Protocol is deliberately serde-only, so a shared error type there gets a hand-written `Display` rather than a `thiserror` dependency. This exists because the Flutter cdylib cannot depend on core at all — see below.
- **Anything persisted in `config.toml` must be modelled by core's `Config`, even when only another crate uses it.** `ConfigStore::mutate` persists by re-serialising the whole `Config` (`config/config_store.rs`, `save_to_disk`), so a table core does not know about is **deleted** by the next write — and every settings-modal edit is a write. `ServerConfig` learned this the hard way: while it lived in `claude-commander-server`, one toggle in the settings modal (or a `PATCH /config`) silently wiped the operator's `[server]` bind address and bearer token, and the next launch generated a token every paired client rejected. It now lives in `config/server.rs` with a regression test (`mutate_preserves_the_server_table`). This does not reverse any dependency — core gained a plain serde struct, not axum — and the *policy* stayed in the server crate (`config::resolve` for `CC_SERVER_*`, `check_no_auth_bind`). Two obligations come with moving a credential into core's `Config`: add it to `Config::with_secrets_redacted` (or `GET /config` serves it to every client) and keep it out of `ConfigPatch`, which is `deny_unknown_fields` so merely naming the field is a 4xx.
- **Never spawn `git` or `gh` with a bare `Command::new`; use `git::git_command()` / `gh_command()` / `git_command_std()` (`git/spawn.rs`).** Every child of the TUI inherits its controlling terminal, and a child that decides to ask a question asks it *there*: OpenSSH's `read_passphrase` opens `/dev/tty` and reads it a byte at a time until a newline, underneath the alternate screen, in a raw mode where Enter never produces one. That is a third reader on the operator's terminal — keystrokes vanish into the prompt, escape sequences split, mouse reports parse as `<`/`>` and resize the session list. It presented for weeks as a suspend/resume bug because the triggers were the 1Password agent declining (vault locked on sleep/screen-lock, or its confirmation dialog), after which ssh under the hourly auto-pull's `git fetch` fell back to a prompt; found live with fd 5 → `/dev/tty` and 205 s in a tty read. The helpers close every prompting route (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GIT_ASKPASS=""`, `BatchMode=yes` — the recipe `clone.rs` already had, now applied everywhere) **and** drop the controlling terminal in the child (`TIOCNOTTY` in `pre_exec`; not `setsid`, which std's `setpgid` ordering defeats), so a tool that ignores the env still finds no terminal to open. `spawn::tests` pin both. The trade is that `core.sshCommand` is overridden and an unknown host key fails the fetch instead of prompting — a fast, legible failure in a background task that had no way to answer anyway.
- **Redact wire-bound text at the value's construction site, not at each place it is later read.** Redacting only where an error is displayed or logged fixes the call sites you found and none of the others you didn't — `CloneRejection::MalformedSlug` still leaked a credential through the one re-validation arm that a call-site-only pass had missed, even after every other known path was covered (`protocol/src/github.rs:541-549`, `redact_credentials`). Redacting when the value is captured — inside the rejection's constructor — means `Display`, `Debug`, and any future `Serialize` impl inherit safety for free, and no later caller has to remember.
- **A route whose request body can carry a credential must use `SafeJson`, not axum's `Json`.** Axum's own `Json` extractor answers a wrong-shaped body with serde's rejection message, which quotes the offending *value* — so posting a malformed body to `POST /api/projects/clone` echoed a pasted token in a 422 response before the handler ran, bypassing every redaction the codebase builds in (`crates/claude-commander-server/src/extract.rs`). `SafeJson` matches on the `JsonRejection` variant and reports only the category, never `body_text()`/`Display`. It's a checked decision per route, not a blanket replacement — serde's detail is worth keeping on a body that cannot hold a secret.
- **`claude-commander-client` and `client/rust` must never gain a normal dependency on `claude-commander-core`.** That is what keeps the Flutter cdylib cross-compilable to Android: core unconditionally pulls gix, crossterm, pty-process/nix and tmux-dependent code, and its `error.rs` `#[from]`-wraps gix/pty/reqwest errors, so *any* core dependency drags the whole set in. (Extracting `claude-commander-tui` removed *ratatui* from that list — core now takes only `ratatui-core` for `[theme]` colours — but the rest still applies, so the rule stands unchanged.) Core is a **dev**-dependency of `client/rust` only (host tests). When a client needs logic that currently lives in core, move the pure part to protocol and rewrite the call sites — do not add the edge, and do not leave a re-export behind.
- **No re-export shims when moving code.** Rewrite the imports at every call site instead of aliasing the old path. A shim means nothing forces callers to acknowledge the new layout, so the old path lingers and the boundary never really moves. Core's existing `pub use`s of ~25 protocol DTOs (`api.rs`, `comment/mod.rs`, `session/types.rs`) are legacy, not a pattern to copy.
- Same rule for binary identity generally: `NAME`/`VERSION` in `main.rs` are the binary's and are what user-facing output uses; `claude_commander_core::VERSION` is the library's (telemetry `lib_version`, server-build comparison) and shouldn't be presented as the app's version. One known exception predates this rule: `tmux/executor.rs` reports core's version as `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` under the name `claude-commander`, because a `TmuxExecutor` has no frontend identity to draw on. Harmless while the workspace shares one version; fixing it means plumbing `FrontendInfo` into the executor.
- **A comment claiming behaviour of code outside this repo must carry its receipt.** This codebase explains itself in prose, which is a strength until a comment asserts something about a *boundary* — the Flutter SDK's key dispatch, a plugin's C source, tmux's env precedence, a rasteriser. Claims about our own code are cheap to check and reviewers do check them; boundary claims get reasoned from plausibility, then read as fact forever. So cite the receipt inline (`window_manager_plugin.cc:512-519`; `KeyEventManager` dispatching to the focus tree regardless of a handler's result), or name the test that pins it, or give the repro method — otherwise phrase it as an assumption ("appears to", "untested on X"). Two corollaries. Where the claim is testable, **the test outranks the comment**: `client/lib/window/window_frame.dart` documented a `HardwareKeyboard` handler as keeping F11 out of the terminal for an entire branch; it never did, and the missing test was the real defect, not the wording. And in review, a receipt-less boundary claim is **unverified by default** — ask where the receipt is, which is how both defects of this kind were caught.

## Architecture

Terminal UI for managing Claude coding sessions via tmux and git worktrees. Each session gets an isolated git worktree, branch, and tmux session.

### Core flow

`App` (TUI main loop) routes through a `CommanderService` (`api.rs`), which owns the `SessionManager` (coordinating `TmuxExecutor` and `GitBackend`/`WorktreeManager`) plus the state/config stores. State is shared via `Arc<RwLock<AppState>>`.

**Layering (CommanderService → API → TUI).** All feature logic lives in the library and is exposed through `CommanderService`; both the CLI and the TUI call it rather than wiring `SessionManager`/stores together themselves. The TUI only renders and dispatches commands — anything worth testing (diff composition/parsing, comment re-anchoring, apply gating, etc.) belongs in the library, where unit tests can reach it without a terminal. When adding a feature, put its logic behind a `CommanderService` method and keep the `tui/` side thin.

**`core` holds no frontend, and must not gain one.** The ratatui frontend lives in `claude-commander-tui` (`App`, the widgets, the review view, and the in-session switcher). Core is frontend-agnostic library code; it depends on `ratatui-core` only, for the `Color` inside `[theme]` config values, and never on full ratatui. That is what keeps the headless `claude-commander-server`, `claude-commander-remote` and the Flutter cdylib from compiling a terminal UI. If you find yourself adding a rendering dependency to core, the code belongs in the TUI crate instead.

**Pure client logic goes in `claude-commander-viewmodel`, not `core`.** There are two shared tiers and only one is reachable by every client: `protocol` (wire contract) and `viewmodel` (pure decisions over a snapshot) have no host deps, so the TUI, the server *and* the Flutter cdylib can all use them. `core` cannot be shared that widely — it is host-bound, and `client/rust` may not depend on it at all — so a decision a client makes about data it already holds must not live there. It did, and the cost was silent: the Flutter client re-implemented the session scorer in Dart, the port was greedy where Skim is optimal, and the two frontends ranked the same list differently (`session_filter.dart` said so in its own doc comment). The rule for the new crate: it renders nothing and touches no I/O — if it needs a terminal, a file, a subprocess or a socket, it belongs in `core` or a frontend. Its `[dependencies]` block is the whole check.

Not folded into `protocol` on purpose: protocol is what the server and its clients must *agree* on, so mixing view-model churn into it makes "is this a wire change?" unanswerable.

Three consequences worth knowing before sharing more with Dart:

- **A bridged function is unreachable from `flutter test`**, which loads no native library. So the *logic* is covered by the Rust crate's tests and the Dart side gets a stand-in — the split `client/test/support/fake_diff_layout.dart` already documents for the diff engine. When moving logic out of Dart, move its tests to Rust in the same commit rather than dropping them.
- **Bridged helpers need an injection seam.** `matchingSessions` takes a `score` parameter; `session_filter.dart` also exposes `debugSessionScorer` for the path that has none (`session_list_page.dart` filters inside `build`). Prefer the parameter; set the override in `setUp` and clear it in `tearDown`.
- **A shared scorer has to be a *function*.** `fuzzy-matcher`'s `SkimMatcherV2` keeps per-thread scratch buffers (`src/skim.rs:610`) grown with `Vec::resize` (`src/skim.rs:395`), which initialises only new cells — so a matcher reused across calls returns history-dependent scores. Caching one in a `static` made `"list-session"` score 142 alone but 145 after a longer haystack, turning a strict ordering into a tie; two frontends on different threads would then rank the same list differently, defeating the point of sharing. `viewmodel::query` builds a fresh matcher per call (measured cost: ~27µs on a 180-field keystroke). Two tests guard it, and they are not equal: `boundary_run_outranks_a_buried_contiguous_run` is the reliable sentinel (it builds its own contamination inside one test thread), while `scoring_is_independent_of_call_history` can false-negative about 1 run in 4 because `thread_local` reuses thread ids after a test thread exits and the test can inherit an already-contaminated cache. If these are ever trimmed, keep the sentinel. Do **not** reach for `use_cache(false)`: in 0.3.7 it panics (`src/skim.rs:929-933` replaces `RefCell`s whose borrows are live). And note the guarantee only holds while both lockfiles agree — the TUI resolves `fuzzy-matcher` through `Cargo.lock`, the cdylib through `client/rust/Cargo.lock`; sharing the source cannot drift but that version can, so bump it in both or neither.
- **`#[frb(sync)]` is available and sometimes required.** Everything else in `client/rust/src/api` is async, which is right for I/O and wrong for per-keystroke work: an async scorer would let a slow frame answer a query the user has moved past. Sync bridges must stay pure CPU over small inputs — they run on Dart's UI isolate. Prefer `i32` over `i64` **where the value provably fits**: frb maps `i64` to `PlatformInt64` (codegen `spec_generator/info.rs:180`), which is `int` natively but `BigInt` on web, and nothing in this app's Dart handles one. A genuinely 64-bit quantity (timestamp-millis, byte counts) stays `i64` — narrowing one would corrupt it. The scorer qualifies for a specific reason, not by luck: Skim computes in `i32` (`fuzzy-matcher-0.3.7 src/skim.rs:350`, `MatrixCell.m_score`) and only widens on return, so `api/query.rs`'s `narrow` is lossless rather than merely improbable to fire.
- **Regenerate with codegen 2.11.1, not the dev shell's.** The frb runtime is pinned `=2.11.1`, but `nix develop .#client` puts nixpkgs' `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` 2.13.0 first on `PATH`. The glue stamps the codegen that wrote it (`FLUTTER_RUST_BRIDGE_CODEGEN_VERSION`, `client/rust/src/frb_generated.rs:39`; `codegenVersion`, `client/lib/src/rust/frb_generated.dart:74`), so a regeneration from the shell rewrites both files for a runtime they were not generated against — what breaks first is untested. `client/README.md`'s frb codegen loop gives the workaround.

Corollaries worth knowing before the next split:

- **Never opportunistically rename anything serde-persisted while moving code.** `config.toml`, `state.json` and `tui.json` shapes must come through untouched by construction. (`config.toml` is never rewritten, so every form its parsers accept is permanently load-bearing — see [Migrations](#migrations).)
- **A crate leaving core brings or defines its own error type**, and never holds a `#[from]` back into core's. `protocol::paste::ImageRejection` is the precedent: a self-contained error with a hand-written `Display`, so the moved code owes core nothing. `claude_commander_tui::TuiError` is the second: it *does* carry a `Core(claude_commander_core::Error)` variant so the source chain survives, but deliberately without `#[from]`, so every crossing is spelled `.map_err(TuiError::Core)` at the call site. There is exactly **one** in the whole crate (`App::run` propagating a failed tmux probe). Functions whose failures are only core's keep returning `claude_commander_core::Result` rather than wrapping for the sake of it — `prefs::persist`, `actions::load_branch_entries`, `switcher::drive_attach`. That the absent `#[from]` forces the choice is the point: when #286's switcher added a new fallible path, the compiler made someone decide which side of the boundary it sat on instead of silently wrapping it.
- **Cross-crate test scaffolding needs a feature, not `#[cfg(test)]`.** A `cfg(test)` item is invisible to another crate's tests. Core's `test-support` feature exposes `backend::mock::MockBackend` and `api::snapshot_from_state`; enable it from `[dev-dependencies]` only, so it never reaches a release build.
- **`cfg!(test)` in core does NOT hold for another crate's tests — and telemetry depended on it.** `telemetry::would_be_enabled` short-circuits on `cfg!(test)`, which is true only while compiling core's *own* test binary. Extracting the frontend therefore made every one of `claude-commander-tui`'s ~870 tests build a live sink and POST `session_start` to the production stream (the extra latency also made timing-sensitive async tests flaky, which is how it was caught — the tests were ~2.5× slower than on main). `would_be_enabled` now also bails under `feature = "test-support"`, so any crate whose tests link core with that feature is inert by construction; `render_tests::telemetry_is_never_live_in_this_crates_tests` pins it against a *default* (telemetry-on) config so the backstop can't be dropped silently. Every fixture that builds a `CommanderService` should ALSO set `config.telemetry.enabled = false` — `test_state`, `create_isolated_config_store` and the TUI's `make_test_app_with_path` all do, each with a guard test. **When adding a crate that tests against core, do both.**
- **Core cannot intra-doc-link into a downstream crate.** References to `claude_commander_tui::…` in core's docs are plain backticked text on purpose (`backend/mod.rs`, `config/view_mode.rs`, `session/board.rs`); making them links would be a broken-link warning, not a nicety.
- **`backend/`'s trait side must not grow host-only dependencies.** Splitting `CommanderBackend` out of core is currently not worth it — the trait's *vocabulary* (api DTOs, session types, `comment::Comment`, config, core errors) is what ties `claude-commander-remote` to core, not the trait itself, so freeing it would mean splitting `api.rs` and the error hierarchy for a crate only ever linked beside core. Keeping host-only deps out of the trait's signatures keeps that option open.

**Still deferred: interactive terminal I/O in core.** `tmux/attach.rs`, `tmux/input.rs` and the conversation device I/O are frontend-shaped code still sitting in core — moving them would delete core's `audio`/`clipboard` features and every downstream `default-features = false`. It is left alone deliberately: that cut line is exactly the trait seam an in-flight voice-forwarding refactor is reworking, so coordinate rather than collide.

### Modules

- **`session/`** — `types.rs` defines `Project` → `WorktreeSession` hierarchy (UUIDs, display as 8-char prefix). `manager.rs` orchestrates lifecycle: create/restart/delete sessions, content/diff retrieval.
- **`api.rs`** — `CommanderService`: the single coordination layer the CLI and TUI both depend on. Query/mutation methods plus `Serialize` response structs (`SessionInfo`, `SessionDetail`, `ReviewSnapshot`, …).
- **`comment/`** — local diff-review comments: `Comment` model + persisted `CommentStore`, snippet-based `reanchor` (drift detection), markdown composition, vim visual-mode selection math, and apply-delivery decision (`decide_send`/`ApplyOutcome`).
- **`tmux/`** — `executor.rs`: async tmux commands with semaphore throttling (default 16 concurrent). `capture.rs`: cached pane content (50ms TTL, xxh3 hash-based staleness). `state.rs`: pattern-based agent state detection. `attach.rs`: PTY-based session attachment. `input.rs`: non-blocking input forwarding.
- **`git/`** — `backend.rs`: pure Rust git via gitoxide (gix crate). `worktree.rs`: uses git CLI for worktree mutations. `diff.rs`: cached diffstat computation (500ms TTL). `review_diff.rs`: structured `file→hunk→line` unified-diff parser and `compose_review_diff` (base→working-tree) for the review view.
- **`term_caps.rs`** — `ColorMode` (COLORTERM/TERM sniffing) plus the tmux colour vocabulary derived from it. Lives in core, not the TUI, because core needs a tmux `status-style` string when it builds a `SessionManager` and the telemetry env fingerprint records the detected capability. `ColorMode::status_bar_colors` is the single source of truth the TUI's tier presets read.
- **`session/lookup.rs`** — `SessionLookup`, `find_session`/`find_session_exact`, `resolve_project_path`. Shared by `api.rs` and the server's HTTP handlers, so *not* CLI-specific despite having once lived in `cli.rs`.
- **`cli.rs`** — genuinely CLI-only now: the `--force`/TTY delete gating (`DeleteGuard`) and the JSON/human output shapes the `claude-commander` binary prints.
- **`config/`** — `settings.rs`: TOML config via figment, layered defaults → file. `storage.rs`: JSON state persistence. `keybindings.rs`: `BindableAction` ↔ key map (palette-only actions may be unbound). `server.rs`: the `[server]` table (bind/port/token/`auto_start`) — see the persisted-config rule below for why it lives in core rather than in the server crate.
- **`telemetry/`** — privacy-respecting usage telemetry. Fixed, typed event schema (`feature(&'static str)` + `session_start`) — **never** free-form text, so typed/session content can't leak by construction. Batched, fire-and-forget HTTP ingest to OpenObserve via a background task; no-op when disabled (config off, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, or no baked credential). Frontends must identify themselves via `FrontendInfo` (panics if empty) — it's a required arg to `CommanderService::new`/`for_cli`. Domain features are recorded inside `CommanderService` methods (covers all frontends); UI-only features are recorded once at the TUI `handle_command` chokepoint via `UserCommand::telemetry_feature`.
- **`error.rs`** — thiserror-based hierarchy: SessionError, TmuxError, GitError, ConfigError, TtsError. No TUI variant — terminal errors are `claude_commander_tui::TuiError`.

### `claude-commander-tui` (the ratatui frontend)

A separate crate (`crates/claude-commander-tui`), depended on only by the `claude-commander` binary:

- **`app/`** (`mod.rs`, `render.rs`, `input.rs`, `modals.rs`, `review.rs`, `settings.rs`, `state.rs`, `actions.rs`, `background.rs`, `conversation.rs`, `event_loop.rs`, `selection.rs`, `switcher.rs`) — main event loop, rendering, modal system, pane management. The full-screen review-diff view is rendered in `app/review.rs` (not a widget).
- **`event.rs`** — `AppEvent`/`UserCommand` enums, key mappings, `EventLoop` multiplexing crossterm + ticks + state updates.
- **`theme.rs`** — the `Theme` presets and the review palette, built for the `ColorMode` core detects.
- **`widgets/`** — TreeList, InfoView, Preview (the list views' right pane), `board/` (kanban view), `pr_colors.rs`, `status_glyph.rs`.
- **`prefs.rs`** — `tui.json` (view mode, last selection, pane width), written through core's `atomic_write`/`open_lock_file` so it takes the same lock discipline as `state.json`.
- **`app/switcher.rs`** — the in-session Alt+Tab switcher, drawn over the attached pane. (It replaced a standalone `picker.rs` that ran in a `tmux display-popup`; #286 deleted that.)
- **`error.rs`** — `TuiError`; see the layering notes above for why it has no `#[from]` into core's.

### The web UI

A browser client served by the server itself, on the API's own port (`claude-commander --serve` and `claude-commander-server` alike). Three places, one direction of flow:

- **`web/`** — the TypeScript source, its tests and the Playwright e2e (`web/e2e/`), with its own dev shell (`nix develop .#web`: node, biome, nixpkgs' Chromium pinned to `@playwright/test`'s version). Nothing here is a Rust build input.
- **`crates/claude-commander-server/webui/`** — the *built* page, committed, and embedded into the binary by rust-embed (`src/webui.rs`). Committed because the nix package build has no node: the flake's `src` filter admits `webui/` and nothing of `web/` (`scripts/check-nix-src-filter.sh` probes both), so what ships is exactly what is checked in. The `web` lane rebuilds it and fails on any difference, so edit the source and run `npm run build`, never the output.
- **`web/src/generated/`** — the wire types, exported from `claude-commander-protocol` by ts-rs (`--features ts`, `src/ts_export.rs`; regenerate with `CC_TS_REGENERATE=1`). **Never hand-write a wire shape in TypeScript** — add the `cfg_attr` derive to the protocol type and export it, for the same reason the Flutter client may not duplicate protocol's rules: a second definition drifts silently, and the drift test is what makes this one loud.

### Key patterns

- Event-driven TUI: `EventLoop` combines terminal input, render ticks, and mpsc state update channels into a single `AppEvent` stream
- **Exactly one thing reads the terminal at a time, and the handoff is awaited.** crossterm's `tty_fd()` is **fd 0** whenever stdin is a tty (`crossterm-0.29.0/src/terminal/sys/file_descriptor.rs:141-152`, the rustix branch this workspace compiles; `:124-127` under `libc` — both open `/dev/tty` only when stdin is *not* one), and the attach pump reads the same line discipline through a fresh open of the terminal's name (`tmux/term_input.rs`). Two live readers split every burst between them, and a split escape sequence is how an SGR mouse report `ESC [ < 35;120;30 M` arrives as the keystrokes `[`, `<`, `3`, `5`, … — with `<`/`>` bound to the divider, moving the mouse then resized the session list. So `EventLoop::stop_input()` is `async` and resolves only once the reader thread has exited, the three callers (`app/mod.rs` before attach and before the editor, `app/switcher.rs` on overlay exit) `.await` it — never `sleep` in its place — and the pump reads a non-blocking `AsyncFd`, because `abort()` cannot cancel a `tokio::io::stdin()` read parked on the blocking pool ("impossible to cancel that read", `tokio-1.52.3/src/io/stdin.rs:16-19`): that orphan eats the next burst. `event::input_reader_tests` and `term_input::tests` pin both halves. The third reader class is **child processes** — see the `git_command()` rule under Coding conventions.
- Caching with TTLs: ContentCapture (50ms) and DiffCache (500ms), both with hash-based change detection
- Modals: Input/Confirm/Help/Error/ReviewDiff overlay the main UI, handled in the TUI crate's `app/modals.rs` + `input.rs`
- Background updater task periodically refreshes agent states for all active sessions

## Config and state files

Paths are determined by the `directories` crate (`ProjectDirs::from("com", "claude-commander", "claude-commander")`) and differ by platform:

| File | macOS | Linux |
|------|-------|-------|
| Config | `~/Library/Application Support/com.claude-commander.claude-commander/config.toml` | `~/.config/claude-commander/config.toml` |
| State | `~/Library/Application Support/com.claude-commander.claude-commander/state.json` | `~/.local/share/claude-commander/state.json` |
| Worktrees | `~/Library/Application Support/com.claude-commander.claude-commander/worktrees/` | `~/.local/share/claude-commander/worktrees/` |

See `Config` struct in `config/settings.rs` for all config fields. The worktrees directory can be overridden via the `worktrees_dir` config option.

TUI-only preferences (session-list view, last selection, pane width) live in a separate `tui.json` alongside `state.json` — see `tui/prefs.rs` (`TuiPrefs`). It's kept out of `state.json` so a remote backend's session data never lands in a file the local TUI persists.

### Migrations

There is deliberately **no single migration framework** — the persisted files have different constraints, so pick the mechanism by what changed, not by habit. In rough order of preference:

- **`#[serde(alias = "…")]`** for a renamed field/variant. Cheapest, and mandatory when renaming anything persisted (a missing alias wipes user data on next load). For `config.toml` the alias is permanent (the file is never rewritten); for JSON state it converges to the new spelling on the next save.
- **Shape-consumed transform** when the change has a self-destructing trigger (an obsolete key, a missing field). Idempotent for free — no marker needed. Two flavours: one-time raw-TOML rewrite for `config.toml` (`config/migrations.rs`, `toml_edit`), and repair-on-every-read on the deserialized model for `state.json` (`AppState::backfill_base_branch`).
- **Schema counter** (`schema_version` + a `migrate_*` fn, e.g. `tui/prefs.rs`) for a one-time mutation that has *no* self-destructing signal — typically resetting a value that can legitimately reappear (e.g. "make X the new default, once, for everyone"). This is the only case that needs a persisted marker.

Two hard rules:

- **Never gate a migration on `AppState.version`** — it's stamped on write but never read, so it can't tell you whether anything ran.
- **Never version-gate `state.json`.** It's multi-writer (two instances under `flock`, *and an older binary may still write it*), so a one-shot gate is unsound: after it flips, an old binary can write old-shape records back and the gate never re-fires. Use repair-on-every-read there. A schema counter is only sound for single-owner machine files like `tui.json`.

## Testing

Unit tests are co-located in source files (`#[cfg(test)]`). Integration tests in `tests/integration_test.rs` require tmux. All async tests use `#[tokio::test]`.

**Render snapshots (insta).** The TUI crate carries visual-regression snapshots, which catch what targeted assertions miss — a column width that shifts, borders that stop joining, a card that loses a line. Two homes, both deliberate:

- `claude-commander-tui/src/render_tests.rs` — TreeList, InfoView, modals, status bar, quick switch, via ratatui's `TestBackend`. Frames widgets with the app's *real* geometry (`app::centered_rect`, `app::confirm_modal_area`) rather than a copy, so a geometry change shows up in the snapshot instead of quietly diverging.
- `claude-commander-tui/src/widgets/board/render.rs` — board snapshots, kept beside the fixture builders and `render` harness its unit tests already use. `BoardWidget::render` writes into a `Buffer` and returns hit-test output, so it isn't a `StatefulWidget` and can't go through `Frame::render_stateful_widget`; a local `buffer_snapshot` formats the buffer the way `TestBackend` would.

Both capture **symbols only, not styles** — that's `TestBackend`'s limitation too. Colour and highlighting stay the job of targeted assertions (e.g. `selected_session_row_is_highlighted`). Run `cargo insta review` to accept or update; never blind-accept a diff, because these are the tests that only fail when rendering genuinely changed.

Snapshots are easy to lose by accident, and this repo has the worked example. #260 deleted `render_tests.rs` and all 27 snapshots as collateral of removing the right-hand preview pane, without saying so; the orphaned `insta` dependency then looked like dead weight and was dropped too. #267 promptly restored the pane — so the coverage had been discarded for a change that was itself reverted. The tests and snapshots are back.

The lesson: **if a change invalidates a snapshot, re-point it at the new UI — don't delete the file.** A deleted snapshot leaves nothing to notice when the UI comes back.

### Test isolation

Tests must not read or modify anything on the real filesystem. Any disk access must go through `tempfile::TempDir` (already in dev-deps) for OS-portable temp paths. Never hardcode `/tmp/...` as a real path. Dummy `PathBuf` values stored in struct fields (never accessed on disk) are acceptable.

**tmux isolation:** tmux clients resolve their socket from the `$TMUX` env var (set inside any tmux session) **in preference to** `$TMUX_TMPDIR` — so a test script that only exports `TMUX_TMPDIR` is NOT isolated when run from inside tmux: its tmux commands (including a cleanup `tmux kill-server`) hit the developer's real server and can kill every open session. Any script that isolates tmux via `TMUX_TMPDIR` must also `unset TMUX TMUX_PANE` (see `client/tool/e2e.sh`), and never run a bare `tmux kill-server` without `$TMUX` provably unset. The Rust integration tests are now genuinely isolated via the `tmux_tmpdir` config knob (set by `crates/claude-commander-test-support`'s `test_state` and core's `create_isolated_config_store`): the `TmuxExecutor` and the `HeadlessAttach` bridge apply `TMUX_TMPDIR` + strip `$TMUX`/`$TMUX_PANE` per-command when it is set, so each test gets its own throwaway tmux server (which exits with its last session) rather than landing on the developer's default server.

### Golden tests

The Flutter client's reference images live in `client/test/goldens/images/` and run as part of `flutter test`. They guard the chrome layer — see the Golden tests section of `client/README.md` for what the harness (`client/test/support/golden.dart`) has to do and why.

**Any change that adds, regenerates or deletes a golden must be verified with `CC_FORCE_NIX=1 scripts/verify.sh --goldens` before pushing** (`--update` regenerates them). A bare `flutter test` is not sufficient evidence: it can pick up a Flutter/Skia other than the pinned one, and the reference images are rasteriser-sensitive by nature. The lane warns when it is using an unpinned `flutter` rather than passing quietly. Then read the image diff before committing — an unexplained pixel change is the entire point of these tests.

What that does and does not buy you, because a golden has already passed locally and failed on the runner:

- **Reproduced by the pinned lane.** The Flutter SDK and its Skia (from the `clientCi` shell in `flake.nix`), the three bundled faces plus `MaterialIcons` resolved from the pinned `FLUTTER_ROOT`, and `devicePixelRatio` 1 (fixed by `useGoldenSurface`). No golden reads a system font, so there is nothing font-related to configure and the host's fontconfig is not consulted.
- **Not reproduced, and not reproducible by any local configuration.** The runner's text antialiasing. The LCARS phone-shell golden failed only on CI for exactly this: 1179 px confined to one 13-row band, geometry byte-identical, i.e. label antialiasing alone (measured from the comparator's own images, run `31333637408`). It was deleted in #280 rather than given a tolerance — a tolerance sized to hide 0.39% also hides a genuinely wrapped label — and its layout is now asserted geometrically in `client/test/phone_shell_test.dart`. Prefer that resolution: when a golden pins the rasteriser rather than the layout, replace it with a geometric assertion instead of loosening the threshold.

So a green `--goldens` lane is strong evidence, not proof. If a golden fails on CI and passes locally, do not re-run blindly — download the `golden-failures` artifact the Client Tests job uploads on failure (`isolated`/`masterImage`/`testImage` PNGs) and measure what moved before deciding whether it is layout or antialiasing.

`TERM` and `COLORTERM` are irrelevant to the goldens themselves — a golden is rasterised by Skia into a PNG with no terminal in the picture. They are not equivalent elsewhere, though, and `scripts/verify.sh` treats them differently:

- `COLORTERM` is read only by `ColorMode::detect()` (`tui/theme.rs`). Tests *do* reach that function — `Theme::default()` is `for_color_mode(detect())` and four board-widget tests construct one (`tui/widgets/board/render.rs`) — but no test **assertion** depends on the result: those four assert cell symbols and returned button/heading/hit regions, never styles, so the detected palette is built and discarded. It is left unset, because pinning it would imply an assertion depends on it.
- `TERM` also reaches `HeadlessAttach::spawn` (`tmux/headless_attach.rs`), which the server's `/ws/attach` integration tests exercise. `fallback_term` normalises an unset/empty/`dumb`/`unknown` `TERM` to `xterm-256color` but passes a real one straight through to `tmux attach`, so a developer in kitty or tmux hands those tests a different `TERM` than a headless host does. `verify.sh` exports `TERM=xterm-256color` for its whole run — the value the fallback would pick anyway — so that path behaves the same in both places.

`verify.sh` exports both `DO_NOT_TRACK` and `TERM` for the whole run rather than per lane, so a lane added later inherits them. That works because a bash `export` overrides whatever the caller had; do not assume a task runner's declarative `env:` block does the same — go-task's, for one, only fills a variable that is *absent* from the caller's environment, and `TERM` is always set in an interactive shell. If you change how either is pinned, verify it by echoing the variable from inside a lane under a deliberately wrong caller value, because a run that merely passes proves nothing here.

### Writing new tests

Use red-green TDD: write a failing test first, then implement the fix. Key areas covered by regression tests:

- **State management** (`config/storage.rs`) — bidirectional session-project linking, cascade delete, active session filtering
- **Status state machine** (`session/types.rs`) — transition guards, timestamp updates, display strings
- **Key mappings** (tui crate's `event.rs`) — every documented keybinding has a test; release/repeat events ignored
- **Config resolution** (`config/settings.rs`) — editor precedence chain, GUI editor auto-detection
- **Widget state** (tui crate's `widgets/`) — TreeListState navigation/wrap/clamp, board cursor clamping/re-anchoring
- **Rendered output** (tui crate's `render_tests.rs`, `widgets/board/render.rs`) — insta snapshots; see above
- **Review view** (tui crate's `app/review.rs`) — `DiffReviewState` file/cursor/scroll navigation, visual-mode selection math, side-by-side row pairing, mouse row mapping
- **Caching** (`tmux/capture.rs`, `git/diff.rs`) — hash determinism, TTL staleness, parse_diff_stat edge cases
- **Name sanitization** (`session/manager.rs`) — branch name generation, special char handling
- **Error types** (`error.rs`) — all variant displays, type conversions

When adding new behavior, add a corresponding unit test that would fail without the change.

## Documentation

When adding or changing config options, hotkeys, or keybindings:

- **README.md** — Update the Keyboard Shortcuts table (kept in the README) to reflect the change
- **docs/configuration.md** — Update the Configuration TOML block (moved here from the README) to reflect the change
- **Help modal** — Update the help text rendered in `app.rs` (`render_help_modal`) so the in-app `?` help stays in sync with the README
- **Settings modal** — Add new config options to `build_settings_rows()` in `app.rs` (General tab) and the corresponding `apply_settings_edit()` match arm so they are editable from the in-app settings UI
- **CLAUDE.md** — No update needed for individual options; the Architecture section points to `Config` struct as the source of truth

**Screenshots are generated, never hand-edited.** Everything in `docs/images/` comes out of `docs/tool/` — one hermetic fixture (`fixture.sh`: temp XDG tree, throwaway tmux server, three demo repos, ten sessions, a stand-in agent) rendered by `capture-tui.sh` (TUI → SVG via Rich) and `capture-client.sh` (the real Flutter app → PNGs). When a UI change dates an image, re-run the capture rather than editing the file; when the demo *content* is wrong, change `cc_seed_fixture`. Never point a capture at real sessions — the fixture exists so a screenshot can't leak a project, branch or prompt.

## Pre-commit hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on every commit, and `dart format` (via `client/tool/dart-format.sh`) when the commit touches Dart. After cloning, run:

```
pre-commit install
```

The `cargo fmt` hook auto-fixes formatting. If `cargo clippy` fails, fix the warnings before committing.

## Git conventions

**CRITICAL: Never force push under any circumstances. This includes `--force`, `--force-with-lease`, and amending commits that have been pushed. Always create new commits instead.**

- Branch names should be lowercase letters with hyphens separating words, no slashes e.g. `refactor-user-service`
- Pull request labels include `dev-review-required`, `ready-for-test`, `trivial`, `tidy`, `merge-on-ci-green`. Do not add labels unless instructed.
- Never skip GPG commit signing
- Precommit hooks may autoformat files while failing the commit; these changes will need to be restaged and the commit reattempted.
- Before committing, always ensure `scripts/verify.sh` passes (fmt, clippy, build, test — no warnings or errors). Fix any issues before creating the commit. Add `--client` when the commit touches `client/`.
- Bug fixes need a regression test too, not just features: follow the red-green TDD rule under [Testing](#testing) — add a test that fails without the fix and passes with it. If the fix lives somewhere untestable (e.g. `main.rs`), push the logic down into testable library code rather than skipping the test.
- Cutting a release: `cargo release {patch,minor,major} --execute` (see CONTRIBUTING.md). Never bump `Cargo.toml` manually.
- The end-to-end sequence for a change — failing test, minimal fix, full suite, review, PR, green CI, merge — is [Workflow: TDD then review then merge](#workflow-tdd-then-review-then-merge). Follow it in order; the bullets above are its repo-specific details.
