//! Command-line argument definitions for this binary.
//!
//! These live in the binary crate because a clap derive takes its program name
//! and version from the package it compiles in: defined here, `--version`
//! reports `claude-commander <version>` with nothing hardcoded and nothing for
//! a rename or a version bump to get wrong. (In the library they resolved to
//! `claude-commander-core`, which also leaked into the generated commander CLI
//! reference as unrunnable `claude-commander-core <sub>` invocations.)
//!
//! Rendering the CLI reference for the commander and conversation `CLAUDE.md`
//! files lives here too, for the same reason: walking a clap tree means
//! depending on clap, and only a binary has a CLI to describe. Core is handed
//! the finished markdown ([`cli_reference`]) and stays clap-free, so embedders
//! of the library don't inherit a CLI parser they have no use for.
