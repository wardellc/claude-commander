//! [`AttachConnection`]: a live attach over the server's `/ws/attach` WebSocket.
//!
//! These are the client-local, transport-concrete attach types. The thin
//! `claude-commander-remote` adapter wraps them into core's transport-neutral
//! `AttachConnection`/`AttachStreams`/`AttachTerminator` seam (a local PTY and
//! this WebSocket then present the same shape to the TUI).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`connect`] performs the synchronous handshake (`auth` → `attach` → await
//! `ready`) and, on success, spawns a **pump task** that owns the split socket
//! for the rest of the attach. The pump is the only thing that touches the
//! socket; the caller reaches it through three seams that [`AttachConnection::split`]
//! hands out:
//!
//! - **reader / writer** — raw PTY bytes both ways. Each direction is a
//!   [`tokio::io::duplex`] pipe: the pump writes inbound binary frames into the
//!   caller's reader and reads the caller's writer to emit outbound binary
//!   frames. A duplex gives bounded buffering — and thus natural backpressure —
//!   for free.
//! - **resizer / terminator** — out-of-band control. These aren't byte streams,
//!   so they ride a separate [`WsControl`] channel wrapped in the [`ControlTx`]
//!   newtype (house style: the raw sender never appears in a signature).
//!   `detach()` sends [`WsControl::Detach`]; the resizer sends
//!   [`WsControl::Resize`].
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! The pump ends — and closes the socket — on any of: a server `detached`/
//! `error` control frame, a transport close/error, an explicit
//! [`WsControl::Detach`], or the caller dropping the streams. It publishes the
//! resulting [`AttachEnd`] through a [`watch`] channel that
//! [`AttachTerminator::wait`] reads. As a belt-and-suspenders against a leaked
//! task, dropping the terminator aborts the pump handle.
//!
//! # Token safety
//!
//! The bearer token reaches the wire only inside the `auth` frame. Every error
//! this module produces is either a fixed transport string or the server's own
//! `error` message — never the token — so it can't leak into a toast or log.
