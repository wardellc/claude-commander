//! WebSocket terminal protocol: framing + control-message types.
//!
//! Two kinds of frame travel over the `/ws/attach` socket, and the split is
//! deliberate:
//!
//! - **Raw PTY bytes use WebSocket *binary* frames.** Terminal output and
//!   keystrokes are arbitrary byte streams — escape sequences and partial
//!   multibyte UTF-8 are routine — so routing them through *text* frames would
//!   corrupt them (text frames must be valid UTF-8). The bridge never sees JSON;
//!   it sees bytes.
//! - **Control messages use WebSocket *text* frames carrying JSON.** These are
//!   small, structured, and human-debuggable: the handshake (`auth`, `attach`),
//!   out-of-band resize, explicit detach, and the server's replies.
//!
//! The server discriminates purely on frame *kind*: a binary frame is always
//! PTY data, a text frame is always a control message. There is no in-band
//! tagging mixing the two, so the discipline can't be violated by a malformed
//! payload.
