//! Structured unified-diff model for the review/diff view.
//!
//! These types are the wire shape of a parsed `file -> hunk -> line` diff: the
//! server parses a unified diff into a [`ParsedDiff`] (via the parser in
//! `claude_commander_core`) and serializes it; clients deserialize it to render
//! gutters, drive line-range selection, and anchor comments.
//!
//! The *parsing* and *hashing* logic stays in core (it needs git plumbing); only
//! the data model lives here so it can cross the network and compile to mobile.
