//! GitHub repo listing + clone wire contract for the "add a project" flow.
//!
//! This lives in the protocol crate for the same reason [`crate::paste`] does:
//! the rules here are *agreed by every party*, not owned by one of them. The
//! server validates a [`CloneRequest`] before it shells out to `git`/`gh`, the
//! Rust client validates before it sends, and the Flutter client validates as
//! the user types so a doomed request never leaves the device. One definition,
//! enforced independently in several places.
//!
//! Three of the four functions here are security boundaries, not conveniences:
//!
//! * [`validate_clone_url`] and [`validate_repo_slug`] gate strings that become
//!   **argv elements** of a `git clone` / `gh repo clone` invocation, and whose
//!   derived directory name becomes a **path** under the user's projects dir.
//!   Both hazards (a leading `-` read as a flag; a `..` segment escaping the
//!   projects dir) are cheap to get wrong and invisible when you do.
//! * [`redact_credentials`] guards the return trip: git echoes the clone source
//!   in its failure messages, so a pasted `https://user:token@…` would ride that
//!   message across the wire and into a UI. The redaction belongs beside the
//!   validators for the same reason they are here — it is a rule every party
//!   depends on, applied where the string is built rather than remembered at
//!   each hop.
//! * [`canonical_repo_slug`] is not a security boundary — it exists so the repo
//!   picker can tell "you already have this one" reliably. `gh repo clone`
//!   honours the user's configured `git_protocol`, so a project cloned by `gh`
//!   often has an `ssh://` origin while the API reports an `https://` clone URL.
//!   Comparing the raw strings misses every such match.
//!
//! Everything here is pure string inspection — no filesystem, no network, no
//! `url` crate — so it cross-compiles wherever the protocol crate does. The
//! *effectful* half (running `gh repo list`, running the clone, registering the
//! resulting project) stays in `claude-commander-core`.
