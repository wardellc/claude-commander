//! The in-session switcher: the real quick-switch palette, drawn over a live
//! tmux pane.
//!
//! Ctrl+Space while attached used to run `tmux display-popup` on a second
//! process of this binary, which read `state.json` off disk and drew its own
//! miniature session list. That picker could not see remote backends, could not
//! run commands, and duplicated the palette's fuzzy/scroll/click handling. Here
//! the TUI keeps the attach suspended (see [`AttachSession`]) and paints
//! [`Modal::QuickSwitch`] itself, so there is exactly one palette in the app.
//!
//! Three things make drawing over someone else's screen work:
//!
//! 1. **A fixed viewport.** ratatui's `Viewport::Fixed` is documented for
//!    "a terminal layout managed by another renderer"
//!    (`ratatui-core/src/terminal/viewport.rs`) — here that renderer is tmux.
//! 2. **A one-time opaque pre-paint.** ratatui only emits cells that differ
//!    from its previous buffer, which starts blank — so a `Clear`ed modal
//!    interior emits *nothing* and the pane shows through. (Styling it
//!    `bg(Color::Reset)` does not help: `Cell::EMPTY` is already `Color::Reset`.)
//!    Painting the rectangle with spaces once, before the first draw, makes the
//!    blank screen match ratatui's blank buffer; every later frame then diffs
//!    correctly, erasing text that goes away.
//! 3. **A repaint on the way out**, via [`AttachRefresher`] — we never have to
//!    remember what we covered.
//!
//! Known limitation: nothing here enables mouse reporting. The TUI disabled its
//! own capture before attaching, so clicks and the wheel reach the palette only
//! when the attached program left the terminal reporting them (tmux with `mouse
//! on`, typically). Turning it on for the overlay would mean changing modes the
//! attached program owns and restoring them exactly on the way out; keyboard
//! navigation works regardless, so that trade isn't worth making.
