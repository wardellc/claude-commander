//! Full-screen review-diff-and-comment view.
//!
//! Presentation only: [`DiffReviewState`] holds what's on screen and is opened
//! via `CommanderService::open_review`. The view is hosted as a maximised
//! modal (`Modal::ReviewDiff`); all diff composition, parsing, and comment
//! logic lives in the library.
//!
//! # What is here, and what is `diffgrid`'s
//!
//! Everything about *laying a diff out* — logical rows, gap expansion, the
//! side-by-side pairing, soft wrapping, role-tagged spans and hit-testing —
//! belongs to [`diffgrid`] and is reached through
//! [`FileLayout`](diffgrid::layout::FileLayout) and [`Grid`](diffgrid::wrap::Grid).
//! What stays here is the *session* half: which file is shown, where the cursor
//! is, which comments are staged and where their boxes go, what is marked
//! reviewed, and the mapping from `diffgrid`'s semantic roles onto the theme
//! (`ReviewPalette`) and onto `syntect` (`SyntectHighlighter`).
//!
//! Comment boxes reach the layout as **attached blocks**: the state tells
//! `diffgrid` only an anchor line and an opaque key, and answers a height
//! callback at render width. That is what keeps every row↔line mapping — cursor,
//! scroll, click — in step with what is drawn, in both layouts, without this
//! module walking rows itself.
