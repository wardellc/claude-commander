//! Kanban board model.
//!
//! Pure transformation from per-backend [`WorkspaceSnapshot`] DTOs + section
//! config into the board the TUI renders: a project sidebar (grouped per
//! server when more than one backend is configured) plus one column per
//! section ("In Progress" catch-all first, then the configured sections in
//! declared order). Each column holds *cards*, where a card is a single stack
//! unit — a PR stack rendered base-first with its children indented, or a lone
//! unstacked session as a one-row card. Sections span backends: cards from
//! every server land in the same shared columns.
//!
//! This lives in the library (not `tui/`) so the stack-grouping, section
//! resolution and flattening logic is unit-testable without a terminal, and it
//! consumes only wire DTOs so local and remote backends drive it identically.
