//! Typing text into an attached pane from outside the attach loop.
//!
//! The attach loop's stdin pump owns the only writer to the pane (a local PTY or
//! a remote WebSocket). Dictation transcripts arrive asynchronously on a task
//! that has no access to that writer, so this module provides the handle through
//! which such a task queues bytes into the pump's outbound buffer — exactly
//! where typed keystrokes go — plus the description of the pane currently on
//! screen that the dictation submit policy needs.

/// [`AttachSession::finish`](crate::tmux::AttachSession::finish) aborts and then
/// awaits before it returns; so once an attach is over, the receiver is dropped
/// and every later `send` is `false`. A failed `send` **is** the "there is no
/// pane to type into" signal, and the only one to route text by.
/// [`is_attached`](Self::is_attached) exists for a different question — may a
/// frontend *start* something whose result would go to a pane? — where a
/// stale answer costs nothing worse than one refused or unneeded recording;
/// the text itself is still delivered, or not, by `send`.
///
/// [`set_pane`](Self::set_pane) carries the other half: *what* is on screen, for
/// the submit policy that decides whether an Enter follows the typed text.
