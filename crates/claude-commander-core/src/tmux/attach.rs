//! Async PTY-based tmux session attachment
//!
//! Provides fully async terminal attachment that runs within the tokio runtime,
//! avoiding the need to drop and recreate the runtime for each attach operation.
//!
//! The stdin pump owns the only writer to the pane, and it takes bytes from two
//! places: the terminal it reads, and the [`PaneInjector`] channel that carries
//! dictation transcripts in from a task that has no writer of its own. Both
//! queue into the same `outbound` buffer, so injected text is delivered exactly
//! as if it had been typed — over a local PTY or a remote WebSocket alike.
