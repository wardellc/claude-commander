//! The one way core spawns `git` and `gh`: detached from the operator's
//! terminal, with every prompting route closed.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The TUI is a full-screen program that owns its terminal, and it spawns `git`
//! and `gh` constantly — worktree ops, diffs, the hourly auto-pull, PR status.
//! Every one of those children inherits the TUI's **controlling terminal**, and
//! a child that decides to ask a question asks it *there*: OpenSSH's
//! `read_passphrase` opens `/dev/tty` and reads it byte by byte until a newline;
//! git's own credential prompt does the same. Nothing about that read is visible
//! to the TUI, which is drawing an alternate screen over the prompt, and the
//! terminal is in raw mode, so Enter is `\r`, never the `\n` ssh is waiting for.
//!
//! The result is a third reader on the terminal, competing with the TUI (or the
//! attach pump) for every burst: keystrokes vanish into the prompt, the ones
//! that get through arrive with their escape sequences split, mouse reports
//! parse as `<`/`>` and resize the session list, and Ctrl+Q reaches the attach
//! only every other press. It looked like a suspend/resume bug because the
//! triggers were "1Password locked the vault" (screen lock, sleep) and "the
//! 1Password agent asked for confirmation" (its dialog) — both make the agent
//! decline, ssh falls back to an identity file or a host-key confirmation, and
//! prompts. Found live: `ssh aur@aur.archlinux.org` under the auto-pull's
//! `git fetch`, fd 5 → `/dev/tty`, blocked in a tty read for 205 s.
//!
//! Two defences, both required:
//!
//! 1. **The environment recipe** ([`apply_noninteractive_env`]) tells git and
//!    ssh not to prompt at all — `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GIT_ASKPASS=""`,
//!    `BatchMode=yes`. This is what `clone.rs` already did for a clone; it now
//!    applies to every spawn. Fast, legible failures instead of hangs.
//! 2. **No controlling terminal** ([`detach_controlling_terminal`], run in the
//!    child between fork and exec). A program that ignores the recipe — a
//!    credential helper, `gh`, some future tool — finds that `open("/dev/tty")`
//!    fails with `ENXIO`, because there is no terminal to open. This is the one
//!    that holds by construction rather than by cooperation.
//!
//! Interactive git — the operator's own shell inside a tmux pane — is not
//! spawned through here and is unaffected.
//!
//! # Why not `setsid`
//!
//! `setsid(2)` would also drop the controlling terminal, but it fails with
//! `EPERM` for a process-group leader, and std makes the child one *before*
//! running `pre_exec` closures whenever `process_group` was set
//! (`library/std/src/sys/process/unix/unix.rs:341` `setpgid`, `:382` the
//! closures) — which [`super::bounded`] does so it can kill a timed-out tree.
//! `TIOCNOTTY` ("give up this controlling terminal", `ioctl_tty(2)`) has no
//! such precondition, and a non-session-leader loses only its own terminal —
//! no `SIGHUP` to anyone. `children_have_no_controlling_terminal` pins it.
