//! Non-interactive, timeout-bounded repository clone.
//!
//! Hosted GitHub and GitLab sources use their respective authenticated CLIs;
//! an explicit URL uses plain `git clone`.
//!
//! The whole module exists to make one failure mode impossible. This clone runs
//! **unattended**, on a machine that may have no terminal at all, and the job
//! watching it (`CloneJobs`) has no way to answer a question. A `git` that stops
//! to ask for a password, or an `ssh` that stops to ask whether an unknown host
//! key is acceptable, does not fail — it waits, forever, with the job stuck in
//! `Running`. So every prompting route is closed up front, and the run is
//! additionally bounded by a wall-clock timeout with a real kill behind it.
//!
//! Nearly every statement above is a claim about code outside this repo. The
//! receipts are inline, and the ones that could be turned into tests were:
//! `the_noninteractive_recipe_stops_git_prompting` pins the env recipe against
//! a real `git`, and `a_timed_out_run_kills_the_child_and_its_descendants` pins
//! the kill.
//!
//! # Known limitation: `core.sshCommand` is not honoured
//!
//! Setting `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` overrides git's `core.sshCommand` config
//! (`git-config(1)`, `core.sshCommand`: "is overridden when the environment
//! variable is set"). So a user who configures their ssh identity there rather
//! than in `~/.ssh/config` will see an ssh clone fail to authenticate here while
//! the same clone works in their shell. **That is the expected behaviour, not a
//! bug to re-diagnose.**
//!
//! It is accepted rather than fixed because the affected population is narrower
//! than it first looks: only *global* and *system* config can apply to a clone,
//! since the repository being cloned does not exist yet and has no local config
//! to read. Preserving the value would cost a `git config --get core.sshCommand`
//! subprocess on every clone, to buy back a case where the alternative is a fast,
//! legible auth error rather than the indefinite hang this module exists to
//! prevent. An inherited `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` *is* preserved — see [`ssh_command`].
