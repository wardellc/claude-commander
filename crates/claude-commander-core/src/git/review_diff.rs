//! Composition of the review diff, and the git-shaped enrichment around it.
//!
//! Unlike [`super::diff`] (which produces only summary stats for the preview
//! pane), the review view needs a `file -> hunk -> line` structure with per-line
//! old/new line numbers to render gutters, drive line-range selection, and
//! anchor comments. **Parsing that structure is [`diffgrid`]'s job**; this module
//! owns everything git-shaped around it that a diff library must not know about:
//! composing the diff in the first place (`git diff`, base/merge-base
//! resolution, the untracked-file half), reading blobs, git-LFS pointer
//! reclassification, and image MIME sniffing.
