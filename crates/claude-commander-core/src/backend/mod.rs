//! The backend seam the TUI drives, in place of wiring `CommanderService` and
//! the stores together itself.
//!
//! A [`CommanderBackend`] is everything the session tree, preview, review view,
//! and attach flow need, expressed over **protocol DTOs** wherever a dedicated
//! wire type exists. A handful of core domain types that are themselves
//! `Serialize`/`Deserialize` still cross the surface where no separate DTO was
//! carved out — [`Comment`](crate::comment::Comment) and
//! [`ApplyOutcome`](crate::comment::ApplyOutcome) (review comments),
//! [`ScanResult`](crate::session::ScanResult) (directory scan), and
//! [`PrCheckResult`](crate::git::PrCheckResult) — so they serialize over the
//! wire unchanged. Two implementations exist:
//!
//! - [`LocalBackend`](local::LocalBackend): wraps an in-process
//!   [`CommanderService`](crate::api::CommanderService); this is what the TUI
//!   and CLI use today.
//! - (Phase F) a remote client that talks to `claude-commander-server` over
//!   HTTP + WebSocket, so the same TUI can drive a machine across the network.
//!
//! Because the trait is object-safe and `Send + Sync` with `Send` futures, the
//! TUI holds an `Arc<dyn CommanderBackend>` and can hand clones to background
//! tasks (`tokio::spawn`) — the poll loops, the review refresh, etc.
//!
//! The interactive attach loop (raw mode, keystroke interception, SIGWINCH) is
//! **not** rewritten here — Phase C lifts it out of `tmux/attach.rs` to run over
//! [`AttachConnection`], which this module defines so both a local PTY and a
//! remote WebSocket can back it.
