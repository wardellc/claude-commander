//! Agent harness abstraction.
//!
//! Claude Commander launches different agent CLIs (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex,
//! OpenCode, Oh My Pi) inside tmux sessions. Each harness differs in how it is
//! resumed, whether it accepts a positional prompt, and what it renders in the
//! tmux pane while working or waiting for the user.
//!
//! [`AgentKind`] is *derived* from the persisted `program` command string (never
//! stored separately) and owns this per-harness behaviour, so the divergences
//! live in one place. Adding a new harness is a new enum variant plus filling in
//! its methods — the compiler then flags every behaviour left unimplemented.

/// Oh My Pi's title is `π <state glyph> <label>`, where the label is the

/// basename) and the state glyph is one of exactly four values: a braille
/// spinner frame while a turn is in flight, `!` while blocked on the user, `>`
/// when idle, or `:` in place of the spinner on Windows. With the state
/// indicator turned off the title is `π: <label>` instead, carrying no state.
///
/// Receipt (omp 17.2.15): the glyph set and the `π <glyph> <label>` assembly are
/// from omp's own title builder, whose state is driven by three transitions —
/// `working` when a turn starts, `attention` when a tool call needs approval or
/// the `ask` tool runs, `idle` when a terminal turn ends. Live confirmations:
/// `π ⠼ omp-support-5e59cfe0` cycling the documented ten frames against a
/// stalling mock endpoint, and `π > omp-support-5e59cfe0` at an idle composer.
///
/// The title is *not* subject to omp's glyph-mode setting, unlike its pane
/// content: driven to ASCII glyph mode — where the same pane's status row
/// degrades to `| Working… [esc]` and its statusline brand to a literal `pi` —
/// the title still read `π > …` idle and `π ⠼ …` working.
///
/// The idle `>` is deliberately *not* treated as conclusive: it returns `None`
/// rather than `Some(Idle)`, because omp ends the turn *before* raising its
/// full-screen plan review — so an idle title can sit above an overlay that is
/// waiting on the user. Falling through lets [`omp_content_state`] see the
/// overlay. Receipt (omp 17.2.15): `handlePlanApproval` awaits an internal
/// `session.abort()` — bracketed by `markPlanInternalAbortPending` /
/// `clearPlanInternalAbortPending`, and called out in omp's own changelog as
/// the "internal approval abort" — which forcibly ends the turn, and only then
/// calls `showPlanReview`. The idle title follows from the terminal turn-end
/// event. The cost of falling through is one extra `capture-pane` per fresh
/// detection, the same price OpenCode already pays; note the hibernation loop
/// and several `CommanderService` paths construct their detector with a
/// `Duration::ZERO` cache deliberately, so they pay it on every tick.
///
/// The flattened `_` in the glyph position is read as the spinner. tmux replaces
/// every non-ASCII character of a pane title with `_` when its server's locale
/// is not UTF-8, so a working omp session reports `_ _ <label>` — brand and
/// spinner both flattened — which is what the author's own sessions look like.
/// The inference is exact rather than a guess about tmux: the glyph position
/// holds one of exactly four values and three of them (`!`, `>`, `:`) are ASCII
/// that passes through untouched, so a replaced glyph can only have been a
/// spinner frame. It cannot mask a pending prompt either, since `attention`
/// renders the ASCII `!` and plan review leaves the ASCII `>`. Should tmux ever
/// substitute something else, this arm simply stops matching and the content
/// fallback covers it.
///
/// Receipts: flattening reproduced on tmux 3.6a — an identical `printf` of
/// `π ⠦ Probe` round-tripped byte-for-byte under `LANG=en_GB.UTF-8` but came
/// back `_ _ Probe` under `LANG=C` and under an unset locale. Only the *title*
/// is affected; pane cells keep their UTF-8 either way, confirmed on a
/// POSIX-locale server whose `capture-pane` returned `⠇`/`⟨esc⟩` intact while
/// that same pane's title read `_ _ <label>`.
