//! Dictation: deciding what a voice transcript should do to the attached pane.
//!
//! Conversation mode speaks a transcript *to* a headless agent; dictation types
//! it *into* whatever pane is on screen, agent or shell. The difference that
//! matters here is that a pane is a terminal, so the transcript is keystrokes:
//! a stray newline in the text is a submit the user never asked for, and an
//! Enter after the text is a submit they may or may not have.
//!
//! Everything in this module is pure — [`plan_dictation`] turns a raw
//! transcript, the configured policy and a description of the pane into a
//! [`DictationPlan`], and something else does the typing. That split is what
//! makes the policy testable without a tmux server: the awkward cases (a
//! transcription engine that returns a trailing newline, a shell pane under an
//! `Always` policy, the per-harness submit delay) are all decided here.
