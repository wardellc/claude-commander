# The same backstop ci.yml:9-18 sets workflow-wide, and for the same reason it
# gives: `cfg!(test)` only suppresses the *core* crate's own unit tests, so
# downstream crates' `cargo test`/`cargo run` link core as a normal dependency and
# would report to the production OpenObserve endpoint via the baked ingest
# credential. Per-fixture config is deliberately not trusted as the only guard.
# This covers the `test`, `cdylib` and `packaging` lanes (packaging *runs* the
# installed binary); e2e.sh sets its own. A verification sweep is not usage, so it
# must never appear in the telemetry stream -- unlike dev-run.sh's non-isolated
# targets, which are genuine usage and deliberately do NOT set this. Exported so
# it survives `nix develop -c`, which is what ci.yml relies on too.
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1

# A verification sweep should not inherit the developer's terminal either.
# `HeadlessAttach::spawn` (crates/claude-commander-core/src/tmux/headless_attach.rs)
# reads TERM and, via `fallback_term`, normalises an unset/empty/"dumb"/"unknown"
# one to xterm-256color while passing a *real* one straight through to
# `tmux attach`. The server's /ws/attach integration tests drive that path, so a
# developer in kitty or tmux hands them different escape sequences than a
# headless CI runner does. Pinning TERM to the value the fallback itself picks
# makes the path behave the same in both places, without asserting anything about
# a runner's environment. Exported, so it survives `nix develop -c`.
#
# COLORTERM is deliberately NOT pinned. It is read only by ColorMode::detect()
# (tui/theme.rs), and while tests do reach that -- `Theme::default()` is
# `for_color_mode(detect())` and four board-widget tests construct one -- no test
# *assertion* depends on the result: those assert cell symbols and returned
# regions, never styles. Pinning it would imply an assertion depends on it.
export TERM=xterm-256color

# And not the developer's git signing either. Test fixtures commit into temp
# repos; one that inherits `commit.gpgsign=true` hangs on a locked 1Password
# signer and passes on an unlocked one. So every lane runs under a global git
# config where signing is on and the signer is `false` (cc_poisoned_gitconfig
# says why a global file and not GIT_CONFIG_COUNT): a fixture that forgets the
# opt-out fails here, at once, on every machine. ci.yml's test steps use the same
# file. Under target/, like the logs, so it outlives the run for a re-run by hand.
