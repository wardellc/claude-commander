# Assert that flake.nix's `src` filter admits only what the claude-commander
# binary is actually built from.
#
# `src` is the sole source input to the package derivation: Nix hashes the
# filtered tree and that hash lands in the .drv, so *any* admitted file forces a
# full (fat-LTO) rebuild when it changes — whether or not cargo ever opens it.
# Docs and the Flutter client under client/ are not part of this binary (root
# Cargo.toml `exclude`s client/, and no workspace crate path-depends on it), so
# they must not be admitted. The client is built and tested by CI's separate
# `client` job, which works from the checked-out worktree and never consults
# `src`.
#
# Both directions are checked, because a filter that admitted nothing at all
# would pass the first half trivially:
#   - probes outside the build inputs must NOT change the src hash
#   - each probe inside the build inputs MUST change it (one evaluation each,
#     so a single admitted probe cannot mask another that was dropped)
#
# Usage: ./scripts/check-nix-src-filter.sh
