# Self-tests for the pure helpers in scripts/lib/dev-common.sh.

# Plain bash assertions, no framework and no new dependencies. Only the pure
# helpers are covered: the ones that map names to names (crate aliases, lane
# exit codes, tier -> lane lists) and the ones that read a value out of a file
# (the Android applicationId, the APK path). The effectful parts of verify.sh /
# dev-run.sh -- entering a nix shell, booting an emulator, running cargo -- are
# not tested here; they need the real toolchain and a device.
#
# Fixtures are created under `mktemp -d`; nothing outside it is read or written.
