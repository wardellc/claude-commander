# Shared helpers for scripts/verify.sh and scripts/dev-run.sh.
#
# Sourced, never executed. The sourcing script owns `set -euo pipefail`; this
# file deliberately does not set shell options so that sourcing it can never
# change the caller's error handling out from under it.
#
# Three groups of things live here:
#
#   * Pure name/value helpers (cc_crate_for_alias, cc_exit_code_for_lane,
#     cc_lanes_for_tier, cc_missing_words, cc_android_package_id, cc_apk_path,
#     cc_flutter_build_args). These are what scripts/tests/run.sh asserts on.
#   * Toolchain entry (cc_run_in_shell), which reproduces the rule already used
#     by client/tool/dart-format.sh: use the tool on PATH if it is there,
#     otherwise re-enter the nix dev shell that provides it.
#   * The lane runner (cc_lane, cc_print_summary), which gives verify.sh its
#     run-everything / distinct-exit-code behaviour.
#   * The git signing poison (cc_poisoned_gitconfig), which verify.sh runs every
#     lane under so a test fixture that would sign a commit fails loudly.
